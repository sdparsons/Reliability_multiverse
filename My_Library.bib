	abstract = {Selective serotonergic reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and cognitive therapies are effective in the treatment of anxiety and depression. Previous research suggests that both forms of treatments may work by altering cognitive biases in the processing of affective information. The current study assessed the effects of combining an SSRI with a cognitive intervention on measures of affective processing bias and resilience to external challenge. A total of 62 healthy participants were randomly assigned to receive either 7 days of citalopram (20 mg) or placebo capsules while also completing either an active or a control version of a computerized cognitive bias training task. After treatment, standard measures of affective processing bias were collected. Participants' resilience to external stress was also tested by measuring the increase in negative symptoms induced by a negative mood induction. Participants who received both citalopram and the active cognitive bias training task showed a smaller alteration in emotional memory and categorization bias than did those who received either active intervention singly. The degree to which memory for negative information was altered by citalopram predicted participants' resistance to the negative mood induction. These results suggest that co-administration of an SSRI and a cognitive training intervention can reduce the effectiveness of either treatment alone in terms of anxiety- and depression-relevant emotional processing. More generally, the findings suggest that pinpointing the cognitive actions of treatments may inform future development of combination strategies in mental health.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The evaluation of interventions and policies designed to promote resilience, and research to understand the determinants and associations, require reliable and valid measures to ensure data quality. This paper systematically reviews the psychometric rigour of resilience measurement scales developed for use in general and clinical populations. METHODS: Eight electronic abstract databases and the internet were searched and reference lists of all identified papers were hand searched. The focus was to identify peer reviewed journal articles where resilience was a key focus and/or is assessed. Two authors independently extracted data and performed a quality assessment of the scale psychometric properties. RESULTS: Nineteen resilience measures were reviewed; four of these were refinements of the original measure. All the measures had some missing information regarding the psychometric properties. Overall, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, the Resilience Scale for Adults and the Brief Resilience Scale received the best psychometric ratings. The conceptual and theoretical adequacy of a number of the scales was questionable. CONCLUSION: We found no current 'gold standard' amongst 15 measures of resilience. A number of the scales are in the early stages of development, and all require further validation work. Given increasing interest in resilience from major international funders, key policy makers and practice, researchers are urged to report relevant validation statistics when using the measures.},

This paper attempts to apply the combined cognitive bias hypothesis (Hirsch, Mathews, \& Clark, 2006) to depression research and reviews competing theoretical frameworks that have guided research in this area. We draw on current findings from behavioral studies on the interplay between depression-related processing biases. These data indicate that various cognitive biases are associated. However, it is not clear whether single or multiple biases are most predictive of depressive symptoms. We conclude this article with theoretical and clinical implications of the current state of research in this field and propose a number of ways in which research on the combined cognitive bias hypothesis can be advanced.},

	abstract = {The Gallup World Poll, the first representative sample of planet Earth, was used to explore the reasons why happiness is associated with higher income, including the meeting of basic needs, fulfillment of psychological needs, increasing satisfaction with one's standard of living, and public goods. Across the globe, the association of log income with subjective well-being was linear but convex with raw income, indicating the declining marginal effects of income on subjective well-being. Income was a moderately strong predictor of life evaluation but a much weaker predictor of positive and negative feelings. Possessing luxury conveniences and satisfaction with standard of living were also strong predictors of life evaluation. Although the meeting of basic and psychological needs mediated the effects of income on life evaluation to some degree, the strongest mediation was provided by standard of living and ownership of conveniences. In contrast, feelings were most associated with the fulfillment of psychological needs: learning, autonomy, using one's skills, respect, and the ability to count on others in an emergency. Thus, two separate types of prosperity-economic and social psychological-best predict different types of well-being.},

Completely mentally healthy adults--individuals free of a 12-month mental disorder and flourishing--reported the fewest missed days of work, the fewest half-day or greater work cutbacks, the healthiest psychosocial functioning (i.e., low helplessness, clear goals in life, high resilience, and high intimacy), the lowest risk of cardiovascular disease, the lowest number of chronic physical diseases with age, the fewest health limitations of activities of daily living, and lower health care utilization. However, the prevalence of flourishing is barely 20\% in the adult population, indicating the need for a national program on mental health promotion to complement ongoing efforts to prevent and treat mental illness.

	abstract = {Emotional biases in attention, interpretation, and memory are viewed as important cognitive processes underlying symptoms of depression. To date, there is a limited understanding of the interplay among these processing biases. This study tested the dependence of memory on depression-related biases in attention and interpretation. Subclinically depressed and nondepressed participants completed a computerized version of the scrambled sentences test (measuring interpretation bias) while their eye movements were recorded (measuring attention bias). This task was followed by an incidental free recall test of previously constructed interpretations (measuring memory bias). Path analysis revealed a good fit for the model in which selective orienting of attention was associated with interpretation bias, which in turn was associated with a congruent bias in memory. Also, a good fit was observed for a path model in which biases in the maintenance of attention and interpretation were associated with memory bias. Both path models attained a superior fit compared with path models without the theorized functional relations among processing biases. These findings enhance understanding of how mechanisms of attention and interpretation regulate what is remembered. As such, they offer support for the combined cognitive biases hypothesis or the notion that emotionally biased cognitive processes are not isolated mechanisms but instead influence each other. Implications for theoretical models and emotion regulation across the spectrum of depressive symptoms are discussed.},

Results The YSI showed high to moderate cross-informant correlations and longitudinal stability. Children scoring high on positive attributes at baseline had fewer psychiatric symptoms and disorders at follow-up, adjusting for symptoms at baseline, disorder at baseline and child and family factors. Analyses with propensity score matching also suggested that positive attributes decrease the likelihood of psychiatric morbidity. Conclusions Children's positive attributes are associated with significantly less psychopathology across time and may be a target for intervention.},

The objective was to determine whether such a mechanism may be allostatic load, a novel concept specifying physiological systems that may suffer cumulative wear and tear following chronic stress, leading collectively to poor health. The study examines the association of allostatic load with environmental and psychological stress in the contexts of dementia caregiving and relinquishment of care, and is a 2-year longitudinal comparison of three groups: 80 new dementia spouse caregivers, 120 veteran caregivers, and 60 non-caregivers. Data comprised allostatic load markers and environmental and psychological stress measures. Cross-lagged analyses produced a statistically significant association between psychological stress and one allostatic load component (primary mediators). Psychological stress was a better predictor of primary mediators than environmental stress. Primary mediators rose with time for caregivers, but not for non-caregivers. A greater rise was evident for caregivers who had relinquished their role by the second year, although the level of psychological stress actually declined. Primary mediators are a key component of the relationship between allostatic load and prior stress. When allostatic load is treated as an outcome of stress, it is important to distinguish environmental and psychological stress.},

However, little is known about the role of positive emotional processing in modulating anxiety reactivity to stress. In the current study, we used an attentional training paradigm designed to experimentally manipulate the processing of positive emotional cues. Participants were randomly assigned to complete a computerized probe detection task designed to induce selective processing of positive stimuli or to a sham condition. Following training, participants were exposed to a laboratory stressor (i.e., videotaped speech), and state anxiety and positive affect in response to the stressor were assessed. Results revealed that individual variability in the capacity to develop an attentional bias for positive information following training predicted subsequent emotional responses to the stressor. Moreover, individual differences in social anxiety, but not depression, moderated the effects of the attentional manipulation, such that, higher levels of social anxiety were associated with diminished attentional allocation toward positive cues. The current findings point to the potential value of considering the role of positive emotional processing in anxiety vulnerability.},

We describe a new rating scale to assess resilience. The Connor-Davidson Resilience scale (CD-RISC) comprises of 25 items, each rated on a 5-point scale (0-4), with higher scores reflecting greater resilience. The scale was administered to subjects in the following groups: community sample, primary care outpatients, general psychiatric outpatients, clinical trial of generalized anxiety disorder, and two clinical trials of PTSD. The reliability, validity, and factor analytic structure of the scale were evaluated, and reference scores for study samples were calculated. Sensitivity to treatment effects was examined in subjects from the PTSD clinical trials. The scale demonstrated good psychometric properties and factor analysis yielded five factors. A repeated measures ANOVA showed that an increase in CD-RISC score was associated with greater improvement during treatment. Improvement in CD-RISC score was noted in proportion to overall clinical global improvement, with greatest increase noted in subjects with the highest global improvement and deterioration in CD-RISC score in those with minimal or no global improvement. The CD-RISC has sound psychometric properties and distinguishes between those with greater and lesser resilience. The scale demonstrates that resilience is modifiable and can improve with treatment, with greater improvement corresponding to higher levels of global improvement.},

We argue that the concept of allostasis can be used instead to describe the mechanisms employed to achieve stability of homeostatic systems through active intervention (adaptive plasticity). In the context of allostasis, resilience denotes the ability of an organism to respond to stressors in the environment by means of the appropriate engagement and efficient termination of allostatic responses. In this review, we discuss the neurobiological and organismal factors that modulate resilience, such as growth factors, chaperone molecules and circadian rhythms, and highlight its consequences for cognition and behavior.},

	abstract = {Objective: Most research on the effects of severe psychological stress has focused on stress-related psychopathology. Here, the author develops psychobiological models of resilience to extreme stress. Method: An integrative model of resil- ience and vulnerability that encompasses the neurochemical response patterns to acute stress and the neural mechanisms mediating reward, fear conditioning and extinction, and social behavior is proposed. Results: Eleven possible neurochemical, neuropeptide, and hormonal mediators of the psychobiological response to extreme stress were identified and related to resil- ience or vulnerability. The neural mecha- nisms of reward and motivation (hedonia, optimism, and learned helpfulness), fear responsiveness (effective behaviors despite fear), and adaptive social behavior (altru- ism, bonding, and teamwork) were found to be relevant to the character traits associ- ated with resilience. Conclusions: The opportunity now exists to bring to bear the full power of advances in our understanding of the neurobiologi- cal basis of behavior to facilitate the dis- coveries needed to predict, prevent, and treat stress-related psychopathology.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increasingly, researchers attend to both positive and negative aspects of mental health. Such distinctions call for clarification of whether psychological well-being and ill-being comprise opposite ends of a bipolar continuum, or are best construed as separate, independent dimensions of mental health. Biology can help resolve this query--bipolarity predicts 'mirrored' biological correlates (i.e. well-being and ill-being correlate similarly with biomarkers, but show opposite directional signs), whereas independence predicts 'distinct' biological correlates (i.e. well-being and ill-being have different biological signatures). METHODS: Multiple aspects of psychological well-being (eudaimonic, hedonic) and ill-being (depression, anxiety, anger) were assessed in a sample of aging women (n = 135, mean age = 74) on whom diverse neuroendocrine (salivary cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, DHEA-S) and cardiovascular factors (weight, waist-hip ratio, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, HDL cholesterol, total/HDL cholesterol, glycosylated hemoglobin) were also measured. RESULTS: Measures of psychological well-being and ill-being were significantly linked with numerous biomarkers, with some associations being more strongly evident for respondents aged 75+. Outcomes for seven biomarkers supported the distinct hypothesis, while findings for only two biomarkers supported the mirrored hypothesis. CONCLUSION: This research adds to the growing literature on how psychological well-being and mental maladjustment are instantiated in biology. Population-based inquiries and challenge studies constitute important future directions.},

In the present article, I draw recent empirical evidence together to support the continued value of computing and seeking to elevate positivity ratios. I also underscore the necessity of modeling nonlinear effects of positivity ratios and, more generally, the value of systems science approaches within affective science and positive psychology. Even when scrubbed of Losada's now-questioned mathematical modeling, ample evidence continues to support the conclusion that, within bounds, higher positivity ratios are predictive of flourishing mental health and other beneficial outcomes.},

	abstract = {When facing stress, most individuals are resilient whereas others are prone to developing mood disorders. The brain mechanisms underlying such divergent behavioral responses remain unclear. Here we used the learned helplessness procedure in mice to examine the role of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a brain region highly implicated in both clinical and animal models of depression, in adaptive and maladaptive behavioral responses to stress. We found that uncontrollable and inescapable stress induced behavioral state-dependent changes in the excitatory synapses onto a subset of mPFC neurons: those that were activated during behavioral responses as indicated by their expression of the activity reporter c-Fos. Whereas synaptic potentiation was linked to learned helplessness, a depression-like behavior, synaptic weakening, was associated with resilience to stress. Notably, enhancing the activity of mPFC neurons using a chemical-genetic method was sufficient to convert the resilient behavior into helplessness. Our results provide direct evidence that mPFC dysfunction is linked to maladaptive behavioral responses to stress, and suggest that enhanced excitatory synaptic drive onto mPFC neurons may underlie the previously reported hyperactivity of this brain region in depression.},

This study examined whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) promotes resilience in an aversive stimulus model of LH. All 55 participants were told that an undisclosed sequence of button presses would terminate an aversive stimulus on their forearm. In truth, only half had control (+C). The other half had no control (-C). All participants received real (R) or sham (S) left DLPFC rTMS during the paradigm (+C/R, -C/S,+C/S,-C/R). We evaluated the cognitive effects of LH using an anagram task. The LH paradigm successfully reduced perceived control in the -C groups. As predicted, the +C/R and +C/S groups tended to give up less quickly and take less time to solve each anagram than did the -C/S group. Superior anagram performance in the -C/R group approached statistical significance. Our preliminary results suggest that manipulating the controllability of an aversive stimulus may induce an LH effect that manifests as impaired anagram performance. Further research is needed to refine this model and determine if DLPFC rTMS mitigates any LH effects.},

The potent trophic actions of exercise, therefore, represent not only an effective means for prevention and treatment of these disorders, they also afford the opportunity to employ exercise paradigms as a basic research tool to uncover the neurobiological mechanisms underlying these disorders. Novel approaches to studying stress-related disorders focus increasingly on trophic factor signaling in corticolimbic circuits that both mediate and regulate cognitive, behavioral, and physiological responses to deleterious stress. Recent evidence demonstrates that the neural plasticity supported by these trophic mechanisms is vital for establishing and maintaining resilience to stress. Therapeutic interventions that promote these mechanisms, be they pharmacological, behavioral, or environmental, may therefore prevent or reverse stress-related mental illness by enhancing resilience. The present paper will provide an overview of trophic mechanisms responsible for the enhancement of resilience by voluntary exercise with an emphasis on brain-derived neurotrophic factor, galanin, and interactions between these two trophic factors.},

The etiology of these trajectories is still unclear. Individual differences in levels of negative and positive emotion are believed to play a role in determining risk and resilience following traumatic exposure. In the current investigation, we followed police officers prospectively from academy training through 48 months of active duty, assessing levels of distress every 12 months. Using latent class growth analysis, we identified 4 trajectories closely conforming to prototypical patterns. Furthermore, we found that lower levels of self-reported negative emotion during academy training prospectively predicted membership in the resilient trajectory compared with the more symptomatic trajectories following the initiation of active duty, whereas higher levels of positive emotion during academy training differentiated resilience from a trajectory that was equivalently low on distress during academy training but consistently grew in distress through 4 years of active duty.

	abstract = {Stressful experiences during early-life can modulate the genetic programming of specific brain circuits underlying emotional and cognitive aspects of behavioral adaptation to stressful experiences later in life. Although this programming effect exerted by experience-related factors is an important determinant of mental health, its outcome depends on cognitive inputs and hence the valence an individual assigns to a given environmental context. From this perspective we will highlight, with studies in rodents, non-human primates and humans, the three-hit concept of vulnerability and resilience to stress-related mental disorders, which is based on gene-environment interactions during critical phases of perinatal and juvenile brain development. The three-hit (i.e., hit-1: genetic predisposition, hit-2: early-life environment, and hit-3: later-life environment) concept accommodates the cumulative stress hypothesis stating that in a given context vulnerability is enhanced when failure to cope with adversity accumulates. Alternatively, the concept also points to the individual's predictive adaptive capacity, which underlies the stress inoculation and match/mismatch hypotheses. The latter hypotheses propose that the experience of relatively mild early-life adversity prepares for the future and promotes resilience to similar challenges in later-life; when a mismatch occurs between early and later-life experience, coping is compromised and vulnerability is enhanced. The three-hit concept is fundamental for understanding how individuals can either be prepared for coping with life to come and remain resilient or are unable to do so and succumb to a stress-related mental disorder, under seemingly identical circumstances.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Stress plays an important role in the onset and recurrence of bipolar disorder (BD). Resilience is the ability to cope with stress or adversity. Few studies have examined resilience in BD, and this study aimed to investigate the clinical correlates of resilience in euthymic patients with BD.

METHODS: A total of 62 outpatients with BD type I, II, and not otherwise specified (NOS) who were in remission and 62 healthy individuals matched with the BD group in terms of age and sex were recruited. All participants completed the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale and Barratt Impulsiveness Scale. A psychiatrist interviewed the subjects to assess clinical characteristics. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with resilience.

RESULTS: The BD group had significantly higher levels of impulsivity and lower levels of resilience compared with the control group. Degree of impulsivity, number of depressive episodes, Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scores, and length of education were significantly correlated with resilience. Attention impulsivity, non-planning impulsivity, and number of depressive episodes were associated with low levels of resilience, even when age, sex, length of education, and CGI scores were controlled.

LIMITATIONS: Because tertiary hospital patients were recruited, the generalizability of the findings is limited.

CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that low levels of resilience are related to high levels of impulsivity and to an increased number of depressive episodes in euthymic patients with BD. Given the reciprocal relationship between resilience and impulsivity, efforts to enhance resilience and reduce impulsivity may make important contributions to the treatment of patients with BD.},

	abstract = {Animals that experience adverse events in early life often have life-long changes to their physiology and behavior. Long-term effects of stress during early life have been studied extensively, but less attention has been given to the consequences of negative experiences solely during the adolescent phase. Adolescence is a particularly sensitive period of life when regulation of the glucocorticoid "stress" hormone response matures and specific regions in the brain undergo considerable change. Aversive experiences during this time might, therefore, be expected to generate long-term consequences for the adult phenotype. Here we investigated the long-term effects of exposure to chronic unpredictable stress during adolescence on adult decision-making, coping response, cognitive bias, and exploratory behavior in rats. Rats exposed to chronic unpredictable stress (e.g., isolation, crowding, cage tilt) were compared to control animals that were maintained in standard, predictable conditions throughout development. Unpredictable stress during adolescence resulted in a suite of long-term behavioral and cognitive changes including a negative cognitive bias [F (1, 12) = 5.000, P {\textless} 0.05], altered coping response [T (1, 14) = 2.216, P = 0.04], and accelerated decision-making [T (1, 14) = 3.245, P = 0.01]. Exposure to chronic stress during adolescence also caused a short-term increase in boldness behaviors; in a novel object test 15 days after the last stressor, animals exposed to chronic unpredictable stress had decreased latencies to leave a familiar shelter and approach a novel object [T (1, 14) = 2.240, P = 0.04; T (1, 14) = 2.419, P = 0.03, respectively]. The results showed that stress during adolescence has long-term impacts on behavior and cognition that affect the interpretation of ambiguous stimuli, behavioral response to adverse events, and how animals make decisions.},

	abstract = {Memory impairment is the most commonly reported cognitive symptom associated with major depressive disorder. Decreased hippocampal volume and neurogenesis in depression link hippocampal dysfunction with deficits in memory. Stress decreases hippocampal dendritic spine density and long-term potentiation (LTP) at glutamate synapses, a cellular correlate of learning and memory. However, elevated plasma levels of 17Œ≤ estradiol (E2) during proestrus increase hippocampal structure and function, directly opposing the negative consequences of stress. In women, significant fluctuations in ovarian hormones likely increase vulnerability of hippocampal circuits to stress, potentially contributing to the greater incidence of depression compared to men. Using the learned helplessness model of depression and ovariectomized female rats, we investigated whether acquisition of helplessness and hippocampal synaptic dysfunction is differentially impacted by the presence or absence of plasma E2. We find that inescapable shock induces a greater incidence of helplessness in vehicle- versus E2-treated OVX rats. In the vehicle-treated group, LTP was absent at CA3-CA1 synapses in slices only from helpless rats, and CA1 spine density was decreased compared to resilient rats. In contrast, significant LTP was observed in slices from E2-treated helpless rats; importantly, spine density was not different between E2-treated helpless and resilient rats, dissociating spine density from the LTP magnitude. We also find that E2 replacement can reverse previously established helpless behavior. Thus, our results show that E2 replacement in OVX rats increases resilience and improves hippocampal plasticity, suggesting that E2 therapy may increase resilience to stress and preserve hippocampal function in women experiencing large fluctuations in plasma estrogen levels.},

The present study sought to examine whether such anxiety-linked attentional biases were associated with either stimulus driven or attentional control mechanisms of attentional selectivity. High and low trait anxious participants completed an emotional variant of an antisaccade task, in which they were required to prosaccade towards, or antisaccade away from a positive, neutral or threat stimulus, while eye movements were recorded. While low anxious participants were found to be slower to saccade in response to positive stimuli, irrespectively of whether a pro- or antisaccade was required, such a bias was absent in high anxious individuals. Analysis of erroneous antisaccades further revealed at trend level, that anxiety was associated with reduced peak velocity in response to threat. The findings suggest that anxiety is associated with the aberrant processing of positive stimuli, and greater compensatory efforts in the inhibition of threat. The findings further highlight the relevance of considering saccade peak velocity in the assessment of anxiety-linked attentional processing.},

Research has investigated the influence of positive emotions on attentional broadening, but the stimulus in the target of attention may also influence attentional breadth, depending on affective stimulus evaluation. Surprised faces are particularly interesting as they are valence ambiguous, therefore, we investigated the relation between affective evaluation-using an affective priming task-and attentional breadth for surprised faces, and how this relation is influenced by resilience. Results show that more positive evaluations are related to more attentional broadening at high levels of resilience, while this relation is reversed at low levels. This indicates that resilient individuals can benefit more from attending to positively evaluated stimuli at the level of attentional broadening.},

The results demonstrated the superior fit of the two orthogonal-factor model thus reconciling the one-dimensional definition of dispositional optimism with the bi-dimensionality of the LOT-R. Moreover, the results of correlational analyses proved the concurrent validity of this self-report measure: optimism is moderately related to indices of psychosocial adjustment and well-being.

However, it is not known if this heterogeneity influences the risk for developing stress related disorders or if it is a biological consequence of the stress response itself. Determining if glucocorticoid response to stress induction prospectively predicts psychological vulnerability to significant real life stressors can adjudicate this issue. To test this relationship, salivary cortisol as well as catecholamine responses to a laboratory stressor during academy training were examined as predictors of empirically identified distress trajectories through the subsequent 4 years of active duty among urban police officers routinely exposed to potentially traumatic events and routine life stressors (N¬†=¬†234). During training, officers were exposed to a video vignette of police officers exposed to real-life trauma. Changes in salivary 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) and cortisol in response to this video challenge were examined as predictors of trajectory membership while controlling for age, gender, and baseline neuroendocrine levels. Officers who followed trajectories of resilience and recovery over 4 years mounted significant increases in cortisol in response to the experimental stressor, while those following a trajectory of chronic increasing distress had no significant cortisol change in response to the challenge. MHPG responses were not associated with distress trajectories. Cortisol response prospectively differentiated trajectories of distress response suggesting that a blunted cortisol response to a laboratory stressor is a risk factor for later vulnerability to distress following significant life stressors.},

The SERT polymorphism altered behavioral adaptation after losses, with increased lose-shift associated with L' homozygosity, while leaving unaffected perseveration after reversal. In contrast, the DAT1 genotype affected the influence of prior choices on perseveration, while leaving lose-shifting unaltered. A model of reinforcement learning captured the dose-dependent effect of DAT1 genotype, such that an increasing number of 9R-alleles resulted in a stronger reliance on previous experience and therefore reluctance to update learned associations.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Cortisol is elevated in individuals with both increased emotional stress and higher percentages of body fat. Cortisol is also known to affect cognitive performance, particularly spatial processing and working memory. We hypothesized that increased body fat might therefore be associated with decreased performance on a spatial processing task, in response to an acute real-world stressor. DESIGN: We tested two separate samples of participants undergoing their first (tandem) skydive. In the first sample (N=78), participants were tested for salivary cortisol and state anxiety (Spielberger State Anxiety Scale) during the plane's 15-min ascent to altitude in immediate anticipation of the jump. In a second sample (N=20), participants were tested for salivary cortisol, as well as cardiac variables (heart rate, autonomic regulation through heart rate variability) and performance on a cognitive task of spatial processing, selective attention and working memory. RESULTS: In response to the skydive, individuals with greater body fat percentages showed significantly increased reactivity for both cortisol (on both samples) and cognition, including decreased accuracy of our task of spatial processing, selective attention and working memory. These cognitive effects were restricted to the stress response and were not found under baseline conditions. There were no body fat interactions with cardiac changes in response to the stressor, suggesting that the cognitive effects were specifically hormone mediated rather than secondary to general activation of the autonomic nervous system. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that, under real-world stress, increased body fat may be associated with endocrine stress vulnerability, with consequences for deleterious cognitive performance.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study sought to examine the relationship among the amount of stress, the perception that stress affects health, and health and mortality outcomes in a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults.

METHODS: Data from the 1998 National Health Interview Survey were linked to prospective National Death Index mortality data through 2006. Separate logistic regression models were used to examine the factors associated with current health status and psychological distress. Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine the impact of perceiving that stress affects health on all-cause mortality. Each model specifically examined the interaction between the amount of stress and the perception that stress affects health, controlling for sociodemographic, health behavior, and access to health care factors.

RESULTS: 33.7\% of nearly 186 million (unweighted n = 28,753) U.S. adults perceived that stress affected their health a lot or to some extent. Both higher levels of reported stress and the perception that stress affects health were independently associated with an increased likelihood of worse health and mental health outcomes. The amount of stress and the perception that stress affects health interacted such that those who reported a lot of stress and that stress impacted their health a lot had a 43\% increased risk of premature death (HR = 1.43, 95\% CI [1.2, 1.7]).

CONCLUSIONS: High amounts of stress and the perception that stress impacts health are each associated with poor health and mental health. Individuals who perceived that stress affects their health and reported a large amount of stress had an increased risk of premature death.},

However, the underlying processes through which mental states improve downstream outcomes are not well understood. To this end, we examined whether reappraising stress-induced arousal could improve cardiovascular outcomes and decrease attentional bias for emotionally negative information. Participants were randomly assigned to either a reappraisal condition in which they were instructed to think about their physiological arousal during a stressful task as functional and adaptive, or to 1 of 2 control conditions: attention reorientation and no instructions. Relative to controls, participants instructed to reappraise their arousal exhibited more adaptive cardiovascular stress responses-increased cardiac efficiency and lower vascular resistance-and decreased attentional bias. Thus, reappraising arousal shows physiological and cognitive benefits. Implications for health and potential clinical applications are discussed.},

	abstract = {To identify molecular mechanisms underlying the prospective health advantages associated with psychological well-being, we analyzed leukocyte basal gene expression profiles in 80 healthy adults who were assessed for hedonic and eudaimonic well-being, as well as potentially confounded negative psychological and behavioral factors. Hedonic and eudaimonic well-being showed similar affective correlates but highly divergent transcriptome profiles. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from people with high levels of hedonic well-being showed up-regulated expression of a stress-related conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA) involving increased expression of proinflammatory genes and decreased expression of genes involved in antibody synthesis and type I IFN response. In contrast, high levels of eudaimonic well-being were associated with CTRA down-regulation. Promoter-based bioinformatics implicated distinct patterns of transcription factor activity in structuring the observed differences in gene expression associated with eudaimonic well-being (reduced NF-Œ∫B and AP-1 signaling and increased IRF and STAT signaling). Transcript origin analysis identified monocytes, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and B lymphocytes as primary cellular mediators of these dynamics. The finding that hedonic and eudaimonic well-being engage distinct gene regulatory programs despite their similar effects on total well-being and depressive symptoms implies that the human genome may be more sensitive to qualitative variations in well-being than are our conscious affective experiences.},

	abstract = {The rate of biological aging is modulated in part by genes interacting with stressor exposures. Basic research has shown that exposure to short-term stress can strengthen cellular responses to stress ("hormetic stress"). Hormetic stress promotes longevity in part through enhanced activity of molecular chaperones and other defense mechanisms. In contrast, prolonged exposure to stress can overwhelm compensatory responses ("toxic stress") and shorten lifespan. One key question is whether the stressors that are well understood in basic models of aging can help us understand psychological stressors and human health. The psychological stress response promotes regulatory changes important in aging (e.g., increases in stress hormones, inflammation, oxidative stress, insulin). The negative effects of severe stress are well documented in humans. Potential positive effects of acute stress (stress resistance) are less studied, especially at the cellular level. Can stress resistance slow the rate of aging in humans, as it does in model organisms? If so, how can we promote stress resistance in humans? We urge a new research agenda embracing the continuum from cellular stress to psychological stress, using basic and human research in tandem. This will require interdisciplinary novel approaches that hold much promise for understanding and intervening in human chronic disease.},

Further, it tested the importance of instructions to imagine the positive training materials. Finally, we examined the effects of this training on imagery vividness. Thirty-nine participants were randomly allocated to imagery CBM-I, a non-imagery control program, or a no treatment control group. Imagery CBM-I led to greater improvements in depressive symptoms, interpretive bias, and imagery vividness than either control condition at post-treatment (n = 13 per group), and improvements were maintained at 2-week follow-up (n = 8 per group). This pilot study provides first preliminary evidence that imagery CBM-I could provide positive clinical outcomes in an Iranian psychiatric setting, and further that the imagery component of the training may play a crucial role.},

The present study sought to examine whether the ambiguity in imagery-based CBM-I is necessary to elicit change in interpretive bias, or, if the emotional content of the imagined scenarios is sufficient to produce such change. An imagery-based CBM-I task was delivered to participants in one of four conditions, where the valence of imagined scenarios were either positive or negative, and the ambiguity of the scenario was either present (until the last word/s) or the ambiguity was absent (emotional valence was evident from the start). Results indicate that only those who received scenarios in which the ambiguity was present acquired an interpretive bias consistent with the emotional valence of the scenarios, suggesting that the act of imagining positive or negative events will only influence patterns of interpretation when the emotional ambiguity is a consistent feature.},

	abstract = {Cognitive bias modification has recently been discussed as a possible intervention for mental disorders. A specific form of this novel treatment approach is approach-avoidance modification. In order to examine the efficacy of approach-avoidance modification for positive stimuli associated with social anxiety, we recruited 43 individuals with social anxiety disorder and randomly assigned them to a training (implicit training to approach smiling faces) or a control (equal approach and avoidance of smiling faces) condition in three sessions over the course of a one-week period. Dependent measures included clinician ratings, self-report measures of social anxiety, and overt behavior during behavioral approach tasks. No group differences in any of the outcome measures were observed after training. In addition, while individuals in the training group showed increased approach tendency in one of the sessions, this effect was inconsistent across the three sessions and did not result in long-term changes in implicit approach tendencies between the groups over the course of the entire study. These results suggest that approach-avoidance modification might result in short-lasting effects on implicit approach tendencies towards feared positive stimuli, but this modification may not result in meaningful behavioral change or symptom reduction in individuals with social anxiety disorder.},

	abstract = {Flourishing--a state of optimal mental health--has been linked to a host of benefits for the individual and society, including fewer workdays lost and the lowest incidence of chronic physical conditions. The aim of this paper was to investigate whether and how routine activities promote flourishing. The authors proposed that flourishers thrive because they capitalize on the processes featured in the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions, specifically by experiencing greater positive emotional reactivity to pleasant events and building more resources over time. To test these hypotheses, the Day Reconstruction Method (DRM) was administered to a prescreened community sample of adults (n = 208), and they were recontacted two to three months later. Results showed that relative to those who did not flourish or were depressed, people who flourish generally responded with bigger "boosts" in positive emotions in response to everyday, pleasant events (helping, interacting, playing, learning, spiritual activity), and this greater positive emotional reactivity, over time, predicted higher levels of two facets of the cognitive resource of mindfulness. In turn, these higher levels of mindfulness were positively associated with higher levels of flourishing at the end of study, controlling for initial levels of flourishing. These results suggest that the promotion of well-being may be fueled by small, yet consequential differences in individuals' emotional experience of pleasant everyday events. Additionally, these results underscore the utility of the broaden-and-build theory in understanding the processes by which flourishing is promoted and provide support for a positive potentiation perspective.},

The present study assessed the more critical question of whether active training is also necessary for modifying subsequent emotional responses to images of new ambiguous scenarios presented after training. As predicted, active training did lead participants to rate their images of emotionally ambiguous scenarios as being more unpleasant after training as compared to a matched passive condition. This finding supports the view that active generation of meaning during interpretive training is critical for the modification of later emotional responses.},

This deterioration in mood raises an important methodological issue and indicates that the increased testing time brought about by auditory compared to visual presentation needs to be addressed.

Interpretation bias was measured by means of a scrambled sentence test, which was presented both before and after the CBM procedure. Participants who read the positive statements made more positive resolutions to the scrambled sentences, while participants who read the negative statements made more negative resolutions. Thus, the appropriate positive and negative interpretative biases were induced by the CBM procedure. However, significant mood changes also occurred following CBM. In Experiment 2, a musical mood induction procedure was presented with depressing or elating music. As before, a scrambled sentence test was presented both before and after the musical mood induction. Mood changed in accordance with the valence of the music to the same extent as with CBM. Critically however, performance on the scrambled sentence task did not change for both groups. This demonstrates that a change in mood state is not sufficient for a change in cognitive bias to occur.},

	abstract = {Background: Attention bias modification (ABM) procedures have been shown to modify biased attention with important implications for emotional vulnerability and resilience. The use of ABM to reduce potentially toxic biases, for instance, is a newly emerging therapy for anxiety disorders. A separate line of gene-by-environment interaction research proposes that many so-called vulnerability genes or risk alleles are better seen as plasticity genes, as they seem to make individuals more susceptible to environmental influences for better and for worse. Methods: A standard ABM procedure was used with a sample of 116 healthy adults. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two training groups. One received an ABM procedure designed to induce a bias in attention toward negative material, while the other was trained toward positive pictures. Individuals with low- and high-expressing forms of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) were compared. Results: Those with a low-expression form (S/S, S/Lg, or Lg/Lg) of the 5-HTTLPR gene developed stronger biases for both negative and positive affective pictures relative to those with the high-expression (La/La) form of the gene. Conclusions: Here, we report the first evidence that allelic variation in the promotor region of the 5-HTTLPR gene predicts different degrees of sensitivity to ABM. These results suggest a potential cognitive mechanism for the gene-by-environment interactions that have been found in relation to the serotonin transporter gene. Variation on this genotype may therefore determine who will benefit most (and least) from therapeutic interventions, adversity, and supportive environments. ?? 2011 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

It is not clear whether this bias is: 1) related to the physiological response to stressful events, and 2) causally related to the development of anxiety disorders. Methods: We tested the predictive value of both preconscious and conscious attention biases in a prospective study of stress reactivity in a nonclinical sample. One hundred four male participants were assessed at baseline and then again 4 months (n = 82) and 8 months later (n = 70). Salivary cortisol and self-report measures were obtained at the baseline testing session in addition to measures of biased attention. Subsequent emotional reactivity was assessed by means of salivary cortisol and self-reported state-anxiety responses during a laboratory-based stressor (4 months later) as well as during a real-life stressor 8 months later (i.e., examination period). Results: Regression analyses indicated that a preconscious negative processing bias was the best predictor of the cortisol response to stressful events. Importantly, a measure of selective processing provided a better indicator of subsequent emotional reactivity than self-report measures of neuroticism, trait-anxiety, and extraversion. Conclusions: These results suggest that preconscious biases toward negative material play a causal role in heightened anxiety vulnerability. Our results illustrate the potential utility of preconscious biases in attention in providing an early marker of anxiety vulnerability and a potential target for treatment intervention. ?? 2010 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

	abstract = {Cognitive theories of depression posit that people's thoughts, inferences, attitudes, and interpretations, and the way in which they attend to and recall information, can increase their risk for depression. Three mechanisms have been implicated in the relation between biased cognitive processing and the dysregulation of emotion in depression: inhibitory processes and deficits in working memory, ruminative responses to negative mood states and negative life events, and the inability to use positive and rewarding stimuli to regulate negative mood. In this review, we present a contemporary characterization of depressive cognition and discuss how different cognitive processes are related not only to each other, but also to emotion dysregulation, the hallmark feature of depression. We conclude that depression is characterized by increased elaboration of negative information, by difficulties disengaging from negative material, and by deficits in cognitive control when processing negative information. We discuss treatment implications of these conclusions and argue that the study of cognitive aspects of depression must be broadened by investigating neural and genetic factors that are related to cognitive dysfunction in this disorder. Such integrative investigations should help us gain a more comprehensive understanding of how cognitive and biological factors interact to affect the onset, maintenance, and course of depression.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To provide UK normative data for the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) and test its convergent, discriminant and construct validity.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional, correlational and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).

METHODS: The DASS was administered to a non-clinical sample, broadly representative of the general adult UK population (N = 1,771) in terms of demographic variables. Competing models of the latent structure of the DASS were derived from theoretical and empirical sources and evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis. Correlational analysis was used to determine the influence of demographic variables on DASS scores. The convergent and discriminant validity of the measure was examined through correlating the measure with two other measures of depression and anxiety (the HADS and the sAD), and a measure of positive and negative affectivity (the PANAS).

RESULTS: The best fitting model (CFI =.93) of the latent structure of the DASS consisted of three correlated factors corresponding to the depression, anxiety and stress scales with correlated error permitted between items comprising the DASS subscales. Demographic variables had only very modest influences on DASS scores. The reliability of the DASS was excellent, and the measure possessed adequate convergent and discriminant validity Conclusions: The DASS is a reliable and valid measure of the constructs it was intended to assess. The utility of this measure for UK clinicians is enhanced by the provision of large sample normative data.},

To provide normative data for the general adult population.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional, correlational and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).

METHODS: The DASS-21 was administered to a non-clinical sample, broadly representative of the general adult UK population (N = 1,794). Competing models of the latent structure of the DASS-21 were evaluated using CFA.

RESULTS: The model with optimal fit (RCFI = 0.94) had a quadripartite structure, and consisted of a general factor of psychological distress plus orthogonal specific factors of depression, anxiety, and stress. This model was a significantly better fit than a competing model that tested the possibility that the Stress scale simply measures NA.

CONCLUSIONS: The DASS-21 subscales can validly be used to measure the dimensions of depression, anxiety, and stress. However, each of these subscales also taps a more general dimension of psychological distress or NA. The utility of the measure is enhanced by the provision of normative data based on a large sample.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We conducted two studies to examine the dimensions, internal consistency reliability estimates, and potential correlates of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21; Lovibond \& Lovibond, 1995).

METHOD: Participants in Study 1 included 887 undergraduate students (363 men and 524 women, aged 18 to 35 years; mean [M] age¬†= 19.46, standard deviation [SD]¬†= 2.17) recruited from two public universities to assess the specificity of the individual DASS-21 items and to evaluate estimates of internal consistency reliability. Participants in a follow-up study (Study 2) included 410 students (168 men and 242 women, aged 18 to 47 years; M age¬†= 19.65, SD¬†= 2.88) recruited from the same universities to further assess factorial validity and to evaluate potential correlates of the original DASS-21 total and scale scores.

RESULTS: Item bifactor and confirmatory factor analyses revealed that a general factor accounted for the greatest proportion of common variance in the DASS-21 item scores (Study 1). In Study 2, the fit statistics showed good fit for the bifactor model. In addition, the DASS-21 total scale score correlated more highly with scores on a measure of mixed depression and anxiety than with scores on the proposed specific scales of depression or anxiety. Coefficient omega estimates for the DASS-21 scale scores were good.

CONCLUSIONS: Further investigations of the bifactor structure and psychometric properties of the DASS-21, specifically its incremental and discriminant validity, using known clinical groups are needed.},

The two factors correlated strongly (0.73). The two subscales showed different predictive validity in a set of hierarchical regression analyses where the focusing subscale made a significant prediction of anxiety scores when depression scores were controlled for, and the shifting subscale significant prediction of depression scores when anxiety scores were controlled for.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: While resilience has been defined as resistance to illness, adaptation, and thriving, the ability to bounce back or recover from stress is closest to its original meaning. Previous resilience measures assess resources that may promote resilience rather than recovery, resistance, adaptation, or thriving.

PURPOSE: To test a new brief resilience scale.

METHOD: The brief resilience scale (BRS) was created to assess the ability to bounce back or recover from stress. Its psychometric characteristics were examined in four samples, including two student samples and samples with cardiac and chronic pain patients.

RESULTS: The BRS was reliable and measured as a unitary construct. It was predictably related to personal characteristics, social relations, coping, and health in all samples. It was negatively related to anxiety, depression, negative affect, and physical symptoms when other resilience measures and optimism, social support, and Type D personality (high negative affect and high social inhibition) were controlled. There were large differences in BRS scores between cardiac patients with and without Type D and women with and without fibromyalgia.

CONCLUSION: The BRS is a reliable means of assessing resilience as the ability to bounce back or recover from stress and may provide unique and important information about people coping with health-related stressors.},

	abstract = {The challenges in our personal, professional, financial, and emotional world are on rise, more so in developing countries and people will be longing for mental wellness for achieving complete health in their life. Resilience stands for one's capacity to recover from extremes of trauma and stress. Resilience in a person reflects a dynamic union of factors that encourages positive adaptation despite exposure to adverse life experiences. One needs to have a three-dimensional construct for understanding resilience as a state (what is it and how does one identify it?), a condition (what can be done about it?), and a practice (how does one get there?). Evaluating the level of resilience requires the measurement of internal (personal) and external (environmental) factors, taking into account that family and social environment variables of resilience play very important roles in an individual's resilience. Protection factors seem to be more important in the development of resilience than risk factors. Resilience is a process that lasts a lifetime, with periods of acquisition and maintenance, and reduction and loss for assessment. Overall, currently available data on resilience suggest the presence of a neurobiological substrate, based largely on genetics, which correlates with personality traits, some of which are configured via social learning. The major questions about resilience revolve around properly defining the concept, identifying the factors involved in its development and recognizing whether it is actually possible to immunize mental health against adversities. In the clinical field, it may be possible to identify predisposing factors or risk factors for psychopathologies and to develop new intervention strategies, both preventive and therapeutic, based on the concept of resilience. The preferred environments for application of resilience are health, education, and social policy and the right approach in integrating; it can be developed only with more research and analysis with focus on resilience. Be it patient or family member or caregiver, advocating resilience will empower psychiatrists in India.},

	abstract = {Emotional resilience can be defined as the ability to maintain healthy and stable levels of psychological functioning in the wake of stress and trauma. Although genes that contribute to psychopathology (often in interaction with environmental stressors) are being detected with increasing consistency, genes that influence resilience to stress have been less studied. In this study, 423 undergraduate college students completed a psychometrically sound 10-item self-report measure of resilience (CDRISC-10) and provided blood for DNA. Linear and logistic regression analyses were used to model relationships between the serotonin transporter promoter polymorphism (5HTTLPR) and CDRISC-10 scores and categories, respectively. CDRISC-10 scores were normally distributed (mean 26.17, SD 5.88 [range 5-40]). In models adjusting for ancestry proportion scores (to mitigate confounding by population stratification) and other covariates, each copy of the "s" allele of 5HTTLPR was associated with approximately 1-point lower CDRISC-10 score. Each copy of the "s" allele was associated with increased (adjusted OR = 1.53, 95\% CI 1.06-2.21, P = 0.024) odds of being in the low resilient category ({\textgreater}1 SD below the mean), compared to being homozygous for the "l" allele. These findings suggest that variation in 5HTTLPR is associated with individual differences in emotional resilience, defined as an individual's ability to withstand and bounce back from stress. This relationship may explain the frequently observed interaction between 5HTTLPR and life stressors in predicting adverse mental health outcomes (e.g., depressive symptoms). Replication is needed, in concert with identification of other genes that influence emotional resilience and related phenotypes.},

Questionnaire data on the adolescents' Ego-resilience (ER89) was collected from mothers, fathers and twins, and analysed by means of multivariate genetic modelling. Variance in trait resilience was best represented in an ADE common pathways model with sex limitation. Variance in the latent psychometric resilience factor was largely explained by additive genetic factors (77\% in boys, 70\% in girls), with the remaining variance (23 and 30\%) attributable to non-shared environmental factors. Additive genetic sources explained more than 50\% of the informant specific variation in mothers and fathers scores. In twins, additive and non-additive genetic factors together explained 40\% and non-shared environmental factor the remaining 60\% of variation. In the mothers' scores, the additive genetic effect was larger for boys than for girls. The non-additive genetic factor found in the twins' self ratings was larger in boys than in girls. The remaining sex differences in the specific factors were small. Trait resilience is largely genetically determined.

METHOD: Electronic and manual literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and PSYCHINFO, using a range of search terms around biological and psychological factors influencing resilience as observed in human and experimental animal studies, complemented by review articles and cross-references. RESULTS: The term resilience is used in the literature for different phenomena ranging from prevention of mental health disturbance to successful adaptation and swift recovery after experiencing life adversities, and may also include post-traumatic psychological growth. Secure attachment, experiencing positive emotions and having a purpose in life are three important psychological building blocks of resilience. Overlap between psychological and biological findings on resilience in the literature is most apparent for the topic of stress sensitivity, although recent results suggest a crucial role for reward experience in resilience. CONCLUSION: Improving the understanding of the links between genetic endowment, environmental impact and gene-environment interactions with developmental psychology and biology is crucial for elucidating the neurobiological and psychological underpinnings of resilience.},

The current research investigated how trait resilience (Block \& Kremen, 1996, ER89) influences recovery from anticipated threats. Participants viewed cues ('aversive', 'threat', 'safety') that signified the likelihood of an upcoming picture (100\% aversive, 50/50 aversive/neutral, or 100\% neutral; respectively), and provided continuous affective ratings during the cue, picture, and after picture offset (recovery period). Participants high in trait resilience (HighR) exhibited more complete affective recovery (compared to LowR) after viewing a neutral picture that could have been aversive. Although other personality traits previously associated with resilience (i.e., optimism, extraversion, neuroticism) predicted affective responses during various portions of the task, none mediated the influence of trait resilience on affective recovery.},

This study attempts to replicate and extend previous empirical support for this model. Using a sample of 185 undergraduates, we assessed whether positive affect and broad-minded coping, interpersonal trust, and social support reciprocally and prospectively predict one another over a two-month period, and whether this upward spiral might be partially based in changes in dopaminergic functioning. As hypothesized, PA and positive coping did mutually build on one another, as did PA and interpersonal trust. Contrary to expectation, PA did not demonstrate an upward spiral relation with social support. Results suggest further study of the relationship between PA and changes in dopamine metabolite levels over time is warranted.},

Unfortunately, because much of psychology's knowledge about how adults cope with loss or trauma has come from individuals who sought treatment or exhibited great distress, loss and trauma theorists have often viewed this type of resilience as either rare or pathological. The author challenges these assumptions by reviewing evidence that resilience represents a distinct trajectory from the process of recovery, that resilience in the face of loss or potential trauma is more common than is often believed, and that there are multiple and sometimes unexpected pathways to resilience.},

Resilience is an inference based on evidence that some individuals have a better outcome than others who have experienced a comparable level of adversity; moreover, the negative experience may have either a sensitizing effect or a strengthening "steeling" effect in relation to the response to later stress or adversity. After noting the crucial importance of first testing for the environmental mediation of risk through "natural experiments," findings are reviewed on "steeling effects" in animal models and humans. Gene-environment interaction findings are considered, and it is noted that there is some evidence that the genetic influences concerns responsivity to all environments and not just bad ones. Life course effects are reviewed in relation to evidence on turning point effects associated with experiences that increase opportunities and enhance coping. Attention is drawn to both research implications and substantive findings as features that foster resilience.},

The suicide rate is higher than the annual mortality from homicide, AIDS, and most forms of cancer. In contrast to nearly all communicable and most non-communicable diseases, there is little evidence that the morbidity and mortality from mental disorders have changed in the past several decades. Mental health advocates, including psychiatric researchers, have pointed to stigma as one of the reasons for the lack of progress with mental illnesses relative to other medical illnesses. This review considers how the expectations and goals of the research community have contributed to this relative lack of progress. In contrast to researchers in cancer and heart disease who have sought cures and preventions, biological psychiatrists in both academia and industry have set their sights on incremental and marketable advances, such as drugs with fewer adverse effects. This essay argues for approaches that can lead to cures and strategies for prevention of schizophrenia and mood disorders.},

First, the results, which are traditionally summarized in an attentional bias index, do not allow for distinguishing between different selective attention processes; orienting and disengagement. Second, different versions of the dot probe task have been used with unknown relative merits. Participants (N=133) completed two versions of the dot probe task: the detection task (i.e. is there a probe?) and the differentiation task (i.e. what sort of probe is it?). The analysis carried out allowed for a differentiation between orienting and disengagement. The main finding was that trait anxiety is related to disengagement difficulties and not to speed of orienting. Concerning the relative merits of the two dot probe task versions, the results suggest that the detection task may be superior to the differentiation task.

PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 5,689 college students participated in the 2007 Healthy Minds Study and completed an Internet survey that included the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form and the Patient Health Questionnaire screening scales for depression and anxiety disorders, questions about suicide ideation, plans, and attempts, and academic impairment.

RESULTS: Just under half (49.3\%) of students were flourishing and did not screen positive for a mental disorder. Among students who did, and those who did not, screen for a mental disorder, suicidal behavior and impaired academic performance were lowest in those with flourishing, higher among those with moderate, and highest in those with languishing mental health.

CONCLUSIONS: Positive mental health complements mental disorder screening in mental health surveillance and prediction of suicidal behavior and impairment of academic performance.},

	abstract = {Governments around the world are recognising the importance of measuring subjective well-being as an indicator of progress. But how should well-being be measured? A conceptual framework is offered which equates high well-being with positive mental health. Well-being is seen as lying at the opposite end of a spectrum to the common mental disorders (depression, anxiety). By examining internationally agreed criteria for depression and anxiety (DSM and ICD classifications), and defining the opposite of each symptom, we identify ten features of positive well-being. These combine feeling and functioning, i.e. hedonic and eudaimonic aspects of well-being: competence, emotional stability, engagement, meaning, optimism, positive emotion, positive relationships, resilience, self esteem, and vitality. An operational definition of flourishing is developed, based on psychometric analysis of indicators of these ten features, using data from a representative sample of 43,000 Europeans. Application of this definition to respondents from the 23 countries which participated in the European Social Survey (Round 3) reveals a four-fold difference in flourishing rate, from 41\% in Denmark to less than 10\% in Slovakia, Russia and Portugal. There are also striking differences in country profiles across the 10 features. These profiles offer fresh insight into cultural differences in well-being, and indicate which features may provide the most promising targets for policies to improve well-being. Comparison with a life satisfaction measure shows that valuable information would be lost if well-being was measured by life satisfaction. Taken together, our findings reinforce the need to measure subjective well-being as a multi-dimensional construct in future surveys.},

METHODS: Participants completed survey measures of mental health, consequences of alcohol use, and engagement in the college environment. RESULTS: In addition to replicating previous findings related to Keyes' Mental Health Continuum, multiple regression analysis revealed several predictors of college student mental health, including supportive college environments, students' sense of belonging, professional confidence, and civic engagement. However, multiple measures of engaged learning were not found to predict mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that supportive college environments foster student flourishing. Implications for promoting mental health across campus are discussed. Future research should build on exploratory findings and test confirmatory models to better understand relationships between the college environment and student flourishing.},

The current studies addressed this need and tested the predictive and convergent validity of the ACS subscales. In Study 1, exploratory factor analysis yielded a two-factor model with Focusing and Shifting subscales. In Study 2, confirmatory factor analysis supported this model and suggested superior fit compared to the factor structure of the Icelandic version (√ìlafsson et al., 2011). Study 3 examined correlations between the ACS subscales and measures of working memory, anxiety, and cognitive control. Study 4 examined correlations between the subscales and reaction times on a mixed-antisaccade task, revealing positive correlations for antisaccade performance and prosaccade latency with Focusing scores and between switch trial performance and Shifting scores. Additionally, the findings partially supported unique relationships between Focusing and trait anxiety and between Shifting and depression that have been noted in recent research. Although the results generally support the validity of the ACS, additional research using performance-based tasks is needed.},

One reason for the enduring nature of social phobia may be the way individuals with the disorder process social information.

In this review of social phobia, probability and cost estimates of social situations are examined, interpretive biases are evaluated and findings relating to memory and negative imagery are also reviewed. The clinical implications of social-phobia-related information-processing biases are discussed and possible avenues for future research are outlined.},

The current experiment investigated the converse possibility: that inducing an inferential bias can change the content of self-related images. The effects of repeated practice in accessing either negative or positive social outcomes was tested by having participants report on self-images generated during subsequent experience with ambiguous social situations. Participants and independent judges rated the content of participants' self-images as being more negative after prior practice in accessing negative rather than positive social outcomes. Furthermore, participants who practiced accessing negative outcomes rated their anticipated anxiety in an imagined stressful social situation as being greater, and their expected social performance as poorer than participants in the positive outcome group. Groups did not differ in state anxiety levels when making their ratings, so it is unlikely that any observed differences between groups can be attributed to mood effects. We suggest that this finding is consistent with the hypothesis that inferential biases and content of self-images can interact with each other and may together serve to maintain social anxiety.},

	abstract = {ual's response to stress and adversity while maintaining mental well-being in terms of an absence of psychopathology. Current models of psychopathology suggest a role of attention in determining vulnerability and resiliency to emotional disorders such as depression and anxiety. For example, recent studies in mood research have shown that whereas enhanced attention toward negative emotional information is associated with greater self-reported depression and anxiety, attention toward positive emotional information may play a role in mood repair. Little is known, however, as to whether or not a positive attention bias serves a protective function against negative mood states. To address this question, studies were conducted to validate a measure of psychological resilience in an undergraduate student population (study 1) and to investigate relationships among trait resiliency, selective attention to emotional information, and mood in response to a negative emotional stressor (studies 2, 3 and 4). The results of this set of studies showed that whereas low trait resiliency was associated higher levels of anxiety and depression, enhanced orienting toward negative emotional information, and slower orienting and faster disengagement away from positive emotional information, high trait resiliency was associated with greater mental well-being, and faster orienting toward and slower disengagement away from positive emotional information. Thus, whereas low trait resiliency individuals demonstrated poorer mental well-being along with attention biases toward negative emotional information and away from positive emotional information, high trait resiliency individuals demonstrated better mental well- being and preferentially attended positive emotional information. Finally, although high and low trait resiliency individuals differed in their attention for positive and negative emotional information, high trait resiliency individuals did not differ from low trait resiliency individuals in their self-reported experience of negative mood in response to an emotional stressor. The results of the present studies provide novel evidence for selective attention processing of emotional information in trait resiliency.},

Interesting item selection bit, looks a little similar to what I am having to do(note on p. 73)
Good idea as with the initial results here to test for main effects within your mean response latencies for something like an effect of probe/stimulus position(note on p. 80)
Is she equating resilience with low depression?(note on p. 131)

Participants consistently trained to interpret emotionally ambiguous passages in either a negative or positive direction show training-congruent effects when presented with new ambiguous material. These training effects are demonstrated by participants' subsequent recognition ratings for disambiguating sentences, which represent both possible meanings of the novel ambiguous test passages. In this series of experiments, we investigated the durability of these training effects over time spans of up to 1 day and found them to be robust. The findings encourage us to believe that induced biases may serve as a useful analogue to those observed clinically.},

	abstract = {Cognitive biases have been theorized to play a critical role in the onset and maintenance of anxiety and depression. Cognitive bias modification (CBM), an experimental paradigm that uses training to induce maladaptive or adaptive cognitive biases, was developed to test these causal models. Although CBM has generated considerable interest in the past decade, both as an experimental paradigm and as a form of treatment, there have been no quantitative reviews of the effect of CBM on anxiety and depression. This meta-analysis of 45 studies (2,591 participants) assessed the effect of CBM on cognitive biases and on anxiety and depression. CBM had a medium effect on biases (g = 0.49) that was stronger for interpretation (g = 0.81) than for attention (g = 0.29) biases. CBM further had a small effect on anxiety and depression (g = 0.13), although this effect was reliable only when symptoms were assessed after participants experienced a stressor (g = 0.23). When anxiety and depression were examined separately, CBM significantly modified anxiety but not depression. There was a nonsignificant trend toward a larger effect for studies including multiple training sessions. These findings are broadly consistent with cognitive theories of anxiety and depression that propose an interactive effect of cognitive biases and stressors on these symptoms. However, the small effect sizes observed here suggest that this effect may be more modest than previously believed.},

Furthermore, we found evidence of changes in emotional vulnerability, congruent with the direction of induced bias, which also persisted for 24 hours.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM) procedures have been used to train individuals to interpret ambiguous information in a negative or benign direction and have provided evidence that negative biases causally contribute to emotional vulnerability.

METHOD: Here we present the development and validation of a new form of CBM designed to manipulate the cognitive errors known to characterize both depression and anxiety. Our manipulation was designed to modify the biased cognitions identified by Beck's cognitive error categories (e.g. arbitrary inference, overgeneralisation) and typically targeted during therapy.

RESULTS: In a later test of spontaneous inferences, unselected (Experiment 1) and vulnerable participants (Experiment 2) who had generated positive alternatives rather than errors perceived novel hypothetical events, their causes and outcomes in a non-distorted manner. These groups were also less vulnerable to two different types of emotional stressor (video clips; and an imagined social situation). Furthermore participants' interpretation of their own performance on a problem-solving task was improved by the manipulation, despite actual performance showing no significant change.

CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that Cognitive Error Modification can promote positive inferences, reduce vulnerability to stress and improve self-perceptions of performance.},

The decoding task briefly presented the stimuli and participants identified the emotion. The cost attribution task asked individuals to rate each stimulus for how costly it would be for them to interact with the person. Random effects regression indicated that social anxiety was not associated with overall decoding accuracy but was associated with a response bias. High socially anxious individuals had a lower threshold for decoding emotions but also more frequently classified low intensity emotions incorrectly. These effects were not emotion-specific. Socially anxious individuals also attributed excessive social cost to expressions of negative valence. Our results provide a novel conceptual framework for understanding emotion decoding in social anxiety, indicating the importance of considering both accuracy and response bias.},

	abstract = {The ability to identify emotion in other people is critical to social functioning. In a series of experiments, we explored the relationship between recognition of emotion in ambiguous facial expressions and aggressive thoughts and behavior, both in healthy adults and in adolescent youth at high risk of criminal offending and delinquency. We show that it is possible to experimentally modify biases in emotion recognition to encourage the perception of happiness over anger in ambiguous expressions. This change in perception results in a decrease in self-reported anger and aggression in healthy adults and high-risk youth, respectively, and also in independently rated aggressive behavior in high-risk youth. We obtained similar effects on mood using two different techniques to modify biases in emotion perception (feedback-based training and visual adaptation). These studies provide strong evidence that emotion processing plays a causal role in anger and the maintenance of aggressive behavior.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM) is a promising treatment for Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD). However, previous randomized trials have not systematically examined the combination of CBM for attention (CBM-A) and interpretation (CBM-I) or the credibility and acceptability of these protocols.

METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial (N = 32) to examine the efficacy of a CBM treatment called Attention and Interpretation Modification (AIM) for SAD. AIM comprised eight, twice weekly computer sessions with no therapist contact. During AIM, participants (1) completed a dot probe task in which probes always followed neutral faces when paired with a disgust face, thereby directing attention away from threat and (2) completed a word-sentence association task in which they received positive feedback for making benign interpretations of word-sentence pairs and negative feedback for making negative interpretations. We also assessed participants' perceived credibility of and satisfaction with AIM.

RESULTS: Participants receiving AIM reported significantly reduced self-reported (Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale) symptoms of social anxiety relative to the placebo. These gains were also evident on a behavioral measure (performance on an impromptu speech). AIM met our benchmarks for credibility and acceptability in this community sample, although credibility ratings were modest. Participants reported that CBM-I was more helpful than CBM-A.

CONCLUSIONS: A combined CBM treatment produced medium-to-large effects on social anxiety. Participants rated AIM as moderately credibly and acceptable. Should these findings be replicated in larger samples, AIM has the potential to be a widely accessible and efficacious treatment for SAD.},

We examined the structure, reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity of the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF), a new self-report questionnaire for positive mental health assessment. We expected that the MHC-SF is reliable and valid, and that mental health and mental illness are 2 related but distinct continua. This article draws on data of the LISS panel of CentERdata, a representative panel for Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences (N = 1,662). Results revealed high internal and moderate test-retest reliability. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) confirmed the 3-factor structure in emotional, psychological, and social well-being. These subscales correlated well with corresponding aspects of well-being and functioning, showing convergent validity. CFA supported the hypothesis of 2 separate yet related factors for mental health and mental illness, showing discriminant validity. Although related to mental illness, positive mental health is a distinct indicator of mental well-being that is reliably assessed with the MHC-SF.},

METHODS: Data were from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study (n = 3032), which at baseline in 1995 measured positive mental health (flourishing and not) and past-year mental illness (major depressive episode, panic attacks, and generalized anxiety disorders), and linked respondents with National Death Index records in a 10-year follow-up ending in 2005. Covariates were age, gender, race, education, any past-year mental illness, smoking, physical inactivity, physical diseases, and physical disease risk factors.

RESULTS: A total of 6.3\% of participants died during the study period. The final and fully adjusted odds ratio of mortality was 1.62 (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.00, 2.62; P =‚Äâ.05) for adults who were not flourishing, relative to participants with flourishing mental health. Age, gender, race, education, smoking, physical inactivity, cardiovascular disease, and HIV/AIDS were significant predictors of death during the study period.

CONCLUSIONS: The absence of positive mental health increased the probability of all-cause mortality for men and women at all ages after adjustment for known causes of death.},

METHODS: Analyses focused on the subsample of 349 monozygotic and 321 dizygotic same-sex twin pairs from a nationally representative sample of twins who completed self-report measures of emotional, psychological, and social well-being.

RESULTS: The best-fit model contained a common pathway to all 3 measures of well-being, no shared environmental effects, and 1 set of parameters for men and women. Heritability for the latent "mental well-being" factor was high (72\%) and best indexed by psychological well-being. Moderate trait-specific genetic effects were seen for emotional and social well-being. Nonshared environmental effects for all measures were mostly trait specific.

CONCLUSIONS: Genetic influences on the measures of mental well-being reflect a single, highly heritable genetic factor, although some trait-specific genetic influences were seen for emotional and social well-being. Moderate proportions of environmental influences were also shared, but the majority of unique environment was trait-specific.},

	abstract = {Mental health has long been defined as the absence of psychopathologies, such as depression and anxiety. The absence of mental illness, however, is a minimal outcome from a psychological perspective on lifespan development. This article therefore focuses on mental illness as well as on three core components of positive mental health: feelings of happiness and satisfaction with life (emotional well-being), positive individual functioning in terms of self-realization (psychological well-being), and positive societal functioning in terms of being of social value (social well-being). The two continua model holds that mental illness and mental health are related but distinct dimensions. This model was studied on the basis of a cross-sectional representative internet survey of Dutch adults (N = 1,340; 18-87 years). Mental illness was measured with the Brief Symptom Inventory and mental health with the Mental Health Continuum Short Form. It was found that older adults, except for the oldest-old, scored lower on psychopathological symptoms and were less likely to be mentally ill than younger adults. Although there were fewer age differences for mental health, older adults experienced more emotional, similar social and slightly lower psychological well-being. In sum, today's older adults have fewer mental illness problems, but they are not in a better positive mental health than today's younger adults. These findings support the validity of the two continua model in adult development.},

Few studies have compared the association of different types of biases and events with depression. The current study examined whether different cognitive biases and stressful childhood events variables were associated with depression and recurrence. Three types of childhood events were assessed in 83 never-depressed and 337 formerly depressed individuals: trauma within the family, trauma outside the family, and adverse events. Furthermore, after a sad mood induction procedure, participants executed a Dot Probe task (selective attentional bias), an Emotional Stroop task (attentional interference bias) and an incidental learning task (memory bias). The association of these measures with case status and recurrence status (one or multiple past episodes) was examined. Negative memory bias and traumatic childhood events within the family were associated with case status, whereas none of the bias measures or childhood events variables were associated with recurrence status. The results indicate that memory bias as well as the experience of aggression and/or abuse within the family during childhood are independently associated with depression. Biases and stressful childhood events did not offer differentiation between individuals with one or multiple past episodes.},

The present study tested the indirect effect of attention bias on memory through interpretation bias as an intervening variable in a mixed sample of non-depressed and subclinically depressed individuals. Subclinically depressed and non-depressed individuals completed a spatial cueing task (to measure attention bias), followed by a scrambled sentences test (to measure interpretation bias), and an incidental free recall task (to measure memory bias). Bias-corrected bootstrapping yielded evidence for the hypothesised indirect effect model, in that an emotional bias in attention is related to a congruent bias in interpretative choices which are in turn reflected in memory. These findings extend previous research and provide further support for the combined cognitive bias hypothesis in depression. Theoretical and clinical implications of our findings are discussed.},

	abstract = {Emotion regulation describes how a subject can use certain strategies to affect emotion response levels. Usually, models for emotion regulation assume mechanisms based on feedback loops that indicate how to change certain aspects of behavior or cognitive functioning in order to get a more satisfactory emotion response level. Adaptation of such feedback loops is usually left out of consideration. This paper introduces an adaptive computational model for emotion regulation by formalizing the model informally described by Gross (1998). The model has been constructed using a high-level modeling language, and integrates both quantitative aspects (such as levels of emotional response) and qualitative aspects (such as decisions to regulate one's emotion). This model includes mechanisms for adaptivity of the degree of flexibility of the emotion regulation process. Also, the effects of events like traumas or therapies on emotion regulation can be simulated. Based on this computational model, a number of simulation experiments have been performed and evaluated. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Everyone experiences stress at one time or another ‚Äì from major events such as the death of a loved one, to more minor stressors such as financial difficul- ties. Not surprisingly, exposure to stress is generally associated with a wide range of negative outcomes, including decreased well-being, increased incidence of disease, post-traumatic stress disorder, general- ized anxiety disorder, and major depressive disorder (Dohrenwend \& Dohrenwend, 1974; Kendler et al., 1999; Monat et al., 2007). However, not all individ- uals who are exposed to even high levels of stress develop such negative outcomes. In fact, recent evi- dence suggests that a considerable number of indi- viduals exhibit resilience, which is commonly defined as maintained or improved mental health in the face of stress, after short disruptions (if any) to normal functioning (Freitas \& Downey, 1998; Rutter, 1999; Luthar et al., 2000); Bonanno, 2005). Note that this definition, which we adapt here, conceptualizes resili- ence as a potential outcome after exposure to stress rather than a psychological trait that leads to positive outcomes (c.f. Norris et al., 2008).},

The researchers assessed naturalistic shifts in attentional bias toward threatening and pleasant schematic face cues in response to five induced mood states in college students. They also assessed state anxiety and satisfaction with life concurrently and 3 weeks later. Controlling for concurrent anxiety, a fear-induced shift in attention to threatening cues was associated with increased levels of later anxiety. Controlling for concurrent life satisfaction, a happiness-induced shift in attention to emotional cues (both threatening and pleasant) was associated with increased levels of later life satisfaction. These results suggest that mood-induced changes in deployment of attention to emotional information may accumulate in ways that impact psychological functioning, yet these effects depend on mood state and the emotional cues afforded by the context.},

Following a cohort of 1,000 children from birth to the age of 32 y, we show that childhood self-control predicts physical health, substance dependence, personal finances, and criminal offending outcomes, following a gradient of self-control. Effects of children's self-control could be disentangled from their intelligence and social class as well as from mistakes they made as adolescents. In another cohort of 500 sibling-pairs, the sibling with lower self-control had poorer outcomes, despite shared family background. Interventions addressing self-control might reduce a panoply of societal costs, save taxpayers money, and promote prosperity.},

We report three studies designed to evaluate the hypothesis that individual differences in readiness to acquire an attentional bias toward threat cues, in response to a contingency that makes the acquisition of such a bias adaptive, underlie individual differences in susceptibility to elevate trait anxiety in response to extended stress. Our findings confirm that the ease with which such a threat bias can be transiently evoked by experimental conditions that encourage its acquisition predicts the degree to which trait anxiety later becomes elevated by extended exposure to a mild stressor. Furthermore, this reflects the fact that such early measures of attentional bias plasticity predict the later naturalistic acquisition of attentional bias in response to subsequent stress, which in turn is associated with a consequent increase in trait anxiety level. These findings are consistent with our proposed account of individual differences in susceptibility to elevate trait anxiety in response to stress.},

	doi = {10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00207},
	abstract = {Emotions can occur during an emotion-eliciting event, but they can also arise when anticipating the event. We used pupillary responses, as a measure of effortful cognitive processing, to test whether the anticipation of an emotional stimulus (positive and negative) influences the subsequent online processing of that emotional stimulus. Moreover, we tested whether individual differences in the habitual use of emotion regulation strategies are associated with pupillary responses during the anticipation and/or online processing of this emotional stimulus. Our results show that, both for positive and negative stimuli, pupillary diameter during the anticipation of emotion-eliciting events is inversely and strongly correlated to pupillary responses during the emotional image presentation. The variance in this temporal interplay between anticipation and online processing was related to individual differences in emotion regulation. Specifically, the results show that high reappraisal scores are related to larger pupil diameter during the anticipation which is related to smaller pupillary responses during the online processing of emotion-eliciting events. The habitual use of expressive suppression was not associated to pupillary responses in the anticipation and subsequent online processing of emotional stimuli. Taken together, the current data suggest (most strongly for individuals scoring high on the habitual use of reappraisal) that larger pupillary responses during the anticipation of an emotional stimulus are indicative of a sustained attentional set activation to prepare for an upcoming emotional stimulus, which subsequently directs a reduced need to cognitively process that emotional event. Hence, because the habitual use of reappraisal is known to have a positive influence on emotional well-being, the interplay between anticipation and online processing of emotional stimuli might be a significant marker of this well-being.},

A group of applicants preparing for a job interview were randomly allocated to an attention training condition versus a control condition. Afterwards, they were asked to give an artificial job interview to a real life jury while being videotaped. Participants in both conditions showed decreased heart rate variability during the job interview, which indicates an overall physiological stress response. However, during a 30-minute follow-up period after the training, indices of heart rate variability showed improved stress recovery only in the attention training condition.

A recently developed methodology to reduce attentional bias has been found to reduce emotional reactivity and anxiety. The present study aimed at identifying the effects of this attentional bias reduction on early and later stages of threat processing. Undergraduates were allocated to an attentional bias reduction (n = 23) versus control condition (n = 25). It was found that attentional bias reduction influenced late but not early stages of threat processing. This finding is of theoretical importance in relation to studies on the causal role of attentional bias and emotional reactivity.

Evidence consistent with the proposition that individuals differ in plasticity is reviewed. The authors document multiple instances in which (a) phenotypic temperamental characteristics, (b) endophenotypic attributes, and (c) specific genes function less like "vulnerability factors" and more like "plasticity factors," thereby rendering some individuals more malleable or susceptible than others to both negative and positive environmental influences.

	abstract = {Objectives Whole systems of complementary and alternative medicine (WSCAM) emphasize positive emergent outcomes for the patient, for example, a sense of well-being. This paper presents a questionnaire-based study in healthy young adults for the purpose of exploring individual differences that contribute to the sense of well-being and to identify characteristics of flourishing versus nonflourishing individuals in terms of nonlinear dynamical systems concepts. Methods Young adult college students (N = 856) completed questionnaires assessing global well-being (Arizona Integrative Outcomes Scale [AIOS]), global physical health, positive and negative mood (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule [PANAS]), resilience (Connor- Davidson Resilience Scale), and repressive defensiveness. Next, subjects were divided into flourisher/languisher groups by a previously determined ratio of positive/negative scores established by a study using complex systems methods. Results Positive-to-negative affect (P:N) ratio accounted for more variance in AIOS (R2 = 0.19; P {\textless} .001) than did separate positive or negative PANAS scores or physical health. Flourishers (14.5\% of the sample) were significantly higher than languishers in defensiveness and resilience. Conclusions Positive-to-negative affect explains a substantial portion of the variance in well-being of healthy young adults. The low percentage of flourishers in this nonclinical sample is consistent with previous population-based studies and suggests that flourishers are a minority, even in nonclinical settings. Positive-to-negative affect may be a useful variable for subsequent prospective studies of applied WSCAM treatments and in well and clinical populations. The well-being measure used in this study is easy to complete, sensitive, and may be a useful clinical measure to track change with treatment over time. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Using the Measure of Affect Regulation Styles (MARS; Larsen \& Prizmic, 2004) with 380 undergraduate students, analyses revealed nine affect regulation strategies (i.e., understanding/analyzing feelings, making plans, talking to someone, doing something enjoyable, being grateful, alcohol use, caffeine use, treating oneself, and consulting an advisor/mentor) that significantly distinguished between languishing and non-languishing individuals (moderate and flourishing) and six affect regulation strategies (i.e., withdrawal, emotion suppression, keep to themselves, downward social comparison, eating something, and daydreaming) that significantly distinguished flourishing individuals from those with moderate emotional health. Significant differences between moderate and flourishing groups consisted of behaviors that 'prevented' rather than 'promoted' flourishing (e.g., behavioral and cognitive avoidance). These findings suggest that in order to achieve flourishing, individuals may need to reduce avoidance strategies and increase engagement strategies. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Faces were selected from the Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces (KDEF) database (Lundqvist, Flykt, \& √ñhman, 1998). In the positive MIP condition, analyses revealed a mood-congruent relation between positive mood and greater attentional deployment to happy faces. In the negative MIP condition, however, analyses revealed a mood-incongruent relation between increased negative mood and greater attentional deployment to happy faces. Furthermore, attentional deployment to happy faces after the negative MIP predicted participants' mood recovery at the end of the experimental session.

We first present a body of research showing that positive emotions broaden cognition and behavioral repertoires, and in so doing, build durable biopsychosocial resources that support coping and flourishing mental health. Next, by explicating the processes through which momentary experiences of emotions may accrue into self-perpetuating emotional systems, the current review proposes an underlying architecture of state-trait interactions that engenders lasting affective dispositions. This theoretical framework is then used to elucidate the cognitive-emotional mechanisms underpinning three disorders of affect regulation: depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia. In turn, two mind training interventions, mindfulness and loving-kindness meditation, are highlighted as means of generating positive emotions that may counter the negative affective processes implicated in these disorders. We conclude with the proposition that positive emotions may exert a countervailing force on the dysphoric, fearful, or anhedonic states characteristic of psychopathologies typified by emotional dysfunctions. ¬© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

From a selective attention standpoint, such mood-related effects should be associated with selective attention biases favoring rewarding stimuli. No prior results along these lines have been reported. Therefore, the authors conducted a systematic program of research designed to document such relations. Study 1 found that daily positive mood states were associated with attention to reward words in a spatial probe task. Studies 2-5 replicated this association in the context of mood manipulations. The latter studies also show that the effect generalizes across different mood manipulation procedures, is specific to positive mood states, and is particularly apparent in relation to rewarding (vs. non-rewarding) positive stimuli. The results extend our knowledge of mood-cognition relations and have important implications for understanding the social cognitive consequences of positive mood states.},

Participants were instructed to make a simple perceptual discrimination response to the target. Immediately before and after attentional training, participants were exposed to a stress task consisting of viewing a series of extremely negative images while having their eyes tracked. Visual fixation time to negative images, assessed with an eye tracker, served as an indicator of using gaze to successfully regulate emotion. Those participants experimentally trained to selectively attend to affectively positive information looked significantly less at the negative images in the visual stress task following the attentional training, thus demonstrating a learned aversion to negative stimuli.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide and, although efficacious treatments are available, their efficacy is suboptimal and recurrence of symptoms is common. Effective preventive strategies could reduce disability and the long term social and health complications associated with the disorder, but current options are limited. Cognitive bias modification (CBM) is a novel, simple, and safe intervention that addresses attentional and interpretive biases associated with anxiety, dysphoria, and depression. The primary aim of this trial is to determine if CBM decreases the one-year onset of a major depressive episode among adults with subsyndromal depression.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nDESIGN AND METHODS: This randomised controlled trial will recruit 532 adults with subsyndromal symptoms of depression living in the Australian community (parallel design, 1:1 allocation ratio). Participants will be free of clinically significant symptoms of depression and of psychotic disorders, sensory and cognitive impairment, and risky alcohol use. The CBM intervention will target attentional and interpretive biases associated with depressive symptoms. The sessions will be delivered via the internet over a period of 52 weeks. The primary outcome of interest is the onset of a major depressive episode according the DSM-IV-TR criteria over a 12-month period. Secondary outcomes of interest include change in the severity of depressive symptoms as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), use of antidepressants or benzodiazepines, and changes in attention and interpretive biases. The assessment of outcomes will take place 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after randomisation and will occur via the internet.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nDISCUSSION: We propose to test the efficacy of an innovative intervention that is well grounded in theory and for which increasing empirical evidence for an effect on mood is available. The intervention is simple, inexpensive, easy to access, and could be easily rolled out into practice if our findings confirm a role for CBM in the prevention of depression.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12613001334796.

Emotion dysregulation is a hypothesized contributor to negative outcomes and to the onset of psychopathology during adolescence. However, the dysregulation of negative emotion has been the focus of research while the literature on positive emotion in adolescent psychopathology is limited. This review highlights both the development of normative and dysregulated positive emotion during adolescence. First, the literature on normative adolescent emotional development and on negative emotional regulation is briefly reviewed, followed by a discussion of current theories of positive emotion, which are grounded in the adult literature. From a developmental perspective, the dimension of approach motivation within positive emotion is emphasized throughout and frames the review. This conceptualization guides organization of literatures on normative experiences of positive emotion in adolescence and the role of dysregulated positive emotion in adolescent psychopathology, specifically adolescent depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, externalizing disorders and eating disorders. Last, future directions in the study of adolescent positive emotion and its regulation and the implications of highlighting approach motivation in normative and dysregulated positive emotion in adolescence are detailed. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

There has been considerable recent interest in determining whether this attentional bias reflects facilitated attentional engagement with and/or impaired attentional disengagement from negative information. We concur with the claim of investigators who have noted that the methodologies previously employed to dissociate engagement and disengagement biases are not optimal for this purpose. In the present study, we employ a novel methodology, the Attentional Response to Distal vs. Proximal Emotional Information (ARDPEI) task, which enables the discrete assessment of these two types of attentional selectivity. The findings demonstrate that facilitated attentional engagement with and impaired attentional disengagement from negative information both characterise elevated anxiety vulnerability. Further, these biases represent distinctive facets of anxiety-linked attentional selectivity. We discuss the potentially differing roles that engagement and disengagement biases may play in the development and/or maintenance of anxiety vulnerability and dysfunction.},

Further self-schema research with depressed and nondepressed persons has suggested the existence of negative self-schemas in depression, lending support to a content-specificity self-schema model. The present studies were designed to investigate the applicability of the self-as-schema model to children and to examine the extent of negative self-schemas in relatively depressed children. A depth-of-processing incidental recall memory paradigm was employed with two groups of normal third- to sixth-grade children. Results supported the self-as-schema model as applied to children, even the youngest group, by indicating superior recall for words encoded under self-reference instructions, compared to semantic or structural orienting instructions. The content-specificity hypotheses were tested with relatively depressed and nondepressed children, and were supported only for the nondepressed children, who recalled mostly positive content words. The relatively depressed children did not demonstrate content specificity in their recall, showing a more "confused" pattern, and the results were discussed in terms of a developmental model of acquisition of depression vulnerability requiring repeated depressive experiences over time. Although the results were consistent with a self-schema approach, current controversies over the implications of depth-of-processing methods require further research to clarify mechanisms of enhanced self-reference recall.},

Without disputing their importance, these foci fail to capture many of the fluctuating, conflicting forces that are readily apparent when people navigate the environment and social world. In this paper, we review literature to offer evidence for the prominence of psychological flexibility in understanding psychological health. Thus far, the importance of psychological flexibility has been obscured by the isolation and disconnection of research conducted on this topic. Psychological flexibility spans a wide range of human abilities to: recognize and adapt to various situational demands; shift mindsets or behavioral repertoires when these strategies compromise personal or social functioning; maintain balance among important life domains; and be aware, open, and committed to behaviors that are congruent with deeply held values. In many forms of psychopathology, these flexibility processes are absent. In hopes of creating a more coherent understanding, we synthesize work in emotion regulation, mindfulness and acceptance, social and personality psychology, and neuropsychology. Basic research findings provide insight into the nature, correlates, and consequences of psychological flexibility and applied research provides details on promising interventions. Throughout, we emphasize dynamic approaches that might capture this fluid construct in the real-world. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Distraction is a strategy that is commonly used to cope with pain. Results concerning the efficacy of distraction from both experimental and clinical studies are variable, however, and indicate that its efficacy may depend on particular circumstances. Several models propose that distraction may be less effective for people who display a large attentional bias towards pain-related information. This hypothesis was tested in an experimental context with 53 pain-free volunteers. First, attentional bias towards cues signalling the occurrence of pain (electrocutaneous stimuli) and towards words describing the sensory experience of this painful stimulus was independently assessed by means of 2 behavioural paradigms (respectively, spatial cueing task and dot-probe task). This was followed by a subsequent distraction task during which the efficacy of distraction, by directing attention away from the electrocutaneous stimuli, was tested. In addition, state-trait anxiety, catastrophic thinking, and initial pain intensity were measured. Results indicated that people who display a large attentional bias towards predictive cues of pain or who initially experience the pain as more painful benefit less from distraction on a subsequent test. No effects were found between attentional bias towards pain words, state-trait anxiety, catastrophic thinking, and the efficacy of distraction. Current findings suggest that distraction should not be used as a 'one size fits all' method to control pain, but only under more specific conditions. ?? 2012 International Association for the Study of Pain.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the most common mental disorders; however, there is no brief clinical measure for assessing GAD. The objective of this study was to develop a brief self-report scale to identify probable cases of GAD and evaluate its reliability and validity. METHODS: A criterion-standard study was performed in 15 primary care clinics in the United States from November 2004 through June 2005. Of a total of 2740 adult patients completing a study questionnaire, 965 patients had a telephone interview with a mental health professional within 1 week. For criterion and construct validity, GAD self-report scale diagnoses were compared with independent diagnoses made by mental health professionals; functional status measures; disability days; and health care use. RESULTS: A 7-item anxiety scale (GAD-7) had good reliability, as well as criterion, construct, factorial, and procedural validity. A cut point was identified that optimized sensitivity (89\%) and specificity (82\%). Increasing scores on the scale were strongly associated with multiple domains of functional impairment (all 6 Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form General Health Survey scales and disability days). Although GAD and depression symptoms frequently co-occurred, factor analysis confirmed them as distinct dimensions. Moreover, GAD and depression symptoms had differing but independent effects on functional impairment and disability. There was good agreement between self-report and interviewer-administered versions of the scale. CONCLUSION: The GAD-7 is a valid and efficient tool for screening for GAD and assessing its severity in clinical practice and research.},

	abstract = {The present paper reports three new experiments suggesting that the valence of a face cue can influence attentional effects in a cueing paradigm. Moreover, heightened trait anxiety resulted in increased attentional dwell-time on emotional facial stimuli, relative to neutral faces. Experiment 1 presented a cueing task, in which the cue was either an "angry", "happy", or "neutral" facial expression. Targets could appear either in the same location as the face (valid trials) or in a different location to the face (invalid trials). Participants did not show significant variations across the different cue types (angry, happy, neutral) in responding to a target on valid trials. However, the valence of the face did affect response times on invalid trials. Specifically, participants took longer to respond to a target when the face cue was "angry" or "happy" relative to neutral. In Experiment 2, the cue-target stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) was increased and an overall inhibition of return (IOR) effect was found (i.e., slower responses on valid trials). However, the "angry" face cue eliminated the IOR effect for both high and low trait anxious groups. In Experiment 3, threat-related and jumbled facial stimuli reduced the magnitude of IOR for high, but not for low, trait-anxious participants.These results suggest that: (i) attentional bias in anxiety may reflect a difficulty in disengaging from threat-related and emotional stimuli, and (ii) threat-related and ambiguous cues can influence the magnitude of the IOR effect.},

Several models have been advanced to explain these biases in anxiety, yet the mechanisms comprising and mediating the biases remain unclear. In the present article, we review evidence regarding the mechanisms of attentional biases through careful examination of the components of attentional bias, the mechanisms underlying these components, and the stage of information processing during which the biases occur. Facilitated attention, difficulty in disengagement, and attentional avoidance comprise the components of attentional bias. A threat detection mechanism likely underlies facilitated attention, a process that may be neurally centered around the amygdala. Attentional control ability likely underlies difficulty in disengagement, emotion regulation goals likely underlie attentional avoidance, and both of these processes may be neurally centered around prefrontal cortex functioning. The threat detection mechanism may be a mostly automatic process, attentional avoidance may be a mostly strategic process, and difficulty in disengagement may be a mixture of automatic and strategic processing. Recommendations for future research are discussed.},

Statistical analyses were performed with the Mx program. In the 1995 data, the best fit model contained one substantially heritable common factor for MD, GAD and panic attacks, and one strongly heritable common factor for the three well-being measures. Genetic and environmental risk factors for IP accounted for, respectively, 50 and 5\%, of the genetic and environmental influences on MWB. We then constructed, using 1995 and 2005 data, two common factors that reflected temporally stable influences on (i) MD and GAD, and (ii) on emotional and psychological well-being. Genetic and environmental risk factors for the stable liability to IP accounted for 41 and 29\% of the stable genetic and environmental influences, respectively, on MWB. This study suggests that genetic risk factors for IP make up 41-50\% of the genetic influences on MWB. The overlap of environmental risk factors is more modest. Although low levels of IP on average reflect a high genetic propensity for MWB, other independent genetic influences play an important role in producing good mental health.},

Depressive, at-risk, and nondepressive participants unscrambled sentences that could from either positive or depressive statements. Half of the participants also received a cognitive load. The results indicated that without a load, at-risk participants showed little evidence of depressive thinking, producing a similar rate of positive statements as did nondepressive individuals and a lower percentage of negative statements than did depressive participants. However, the cognitive load caused an increase in at-risk participants' production of negative statements, revealing a previously undetected tendency toward negative thinking that made them resemble depressive participants. As predicted, this effect was especially pronounced among individuals who routinely engaged in thought suppression.},

Participants chose the emotion matching the anti-expression they were adapted to significantly more often than they chose any other emotion (e.g., if they were adapted to antifear, they classified the emotion on the average face as fear). The strength of this aftereffect of adaptation decreased as the strength of the anti-expression adapter decreased. These findings provide evidence that visual representations of facial expressions of emotion are coded with reference to a prototype within a multidimensional framework.},

The ANEW, IAPS, and IADS are being developed and distributed by NIMH Center for Emotion and Attention (CSEA) investigators Margaret Bradley and Peter Lang, in order to provide standardized materials that are available to researchers in the study of emotion and attention.

MCMis the tendency for depressed individuals to retrieve more unpleasant information from memory than nondepressed controls, and may be an important maintenance mechanism in depression. MCM has been studied frequently with explicit memory tests, but relatively few studies have investigated MCM using implicit memory tests. I describe several implicit memory studies which show that: (a) an implicit MCM bias does not appear to exist when perceptually driven tests are used; (b) implicit memory bias can be found when conceptually driven tests are used, but (c) not all conceptually driven tests show implicit MCM bias. I conclude that conceptual processing is necessary, but is not sufficient for demonstrating implicit memory bias in depression. Future studies should investigate specific components of conceptual elaboration that support implicit memory bias in depression.},

Asymmetric recall favoring positive stimuli appears to be part of the normative pattern of memory performance among individuals that have been labeled normal nondepressed (ah = .15; p {\textless} ,001); subclinically de- pressed individuals show symmetric recall of positively and negatively valenced material (Jh = - .02; p {\textgreater} .20).

HTA and LTA undergraduates performed a modified exogenous cueing task, in which the location of a target was correctly or incorrectly cued by neutral, highly and mildly threatening pictures. Results indicate that at 100 ms picture presentation, HTA individuals more strongly engaged their attention with and showed impaired disengagement from highly threatening pictures than LTA individuals. In addition, HTA individuals showed a stronger tendency to attentional avoidance of threat at the 200 and 500 ms picture presentation. These data provide evidence for differential patterns of anxiety-related biases in attentive processing of threat at early versus later stages of information processing. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

We argue that the findings in the dot probe paradigm are ambiguous evidence for the vigilance to threat hypothesis. Results can also be interpreted as a difficulty to disengage from threat. In this study, 44 undergraduates performed a pictorial version of the probe detection task. Taking into account the reaction times on neutral trials, we found no evidence for a facilitated detection of threatening information.

In the present article, we review evidence regarding the mechanisms of attentional biases through careful examination of the components of attentional bias, the mechanisms underlying these components, and the stage of information processing during which the biases occur. Facilitated attention, difficulty in disengagement, and attentional avoidance comprise the components of attentional bias. A threat detection mechanism likely underlies facilitated attention, a process that may be neurally centered around the amygdala. Attentional control ability likely underlies difficulty in disengagement, emotion regulation goals likely underlie attentional avoidance, and both of these processes may be neurally centered around prefrontal cortex functioning. The threat detection mechanism may be a mostly automatic process, attentional avoidance may be a mostly strategic process, and difficulty in disengagement may be a mixture of automatic and strategic processing.

In the current paper, we report a direct test of this hypothesis in individuals with social phobia. Participants performed a variation of the Posner paradigm (Quart. J. Exp. Psycho. 32 (1980) 3). Social threat, neutral, or positive words cued one of two locations on the computer screen. After the cue disappeared, participants had to detect a probe ("*") that appeared in one of the two locations. On some trials the cue was valid (i.e., the probe appeared in the same location as the cue). On other trials the cue was invalid (the probe appeared in a different location than the cue). Yet, on other trials, no cue was presented. All participants were slower in detecting probes following invalid cues than probes following valid cues. Furthermore, individuals with social phobia showed significantly longer response latencies when detecting invalidly cued targets than did controls, but only when the probe followed a social threat word. These results suggest that individuals with social phobia may have difficulty disengaging their attention from socially threatening material. ?? 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

In a third experiment using the same task but with a longer cue exposure, a related disengagement difficulty occurred across both groups, although the more general slowing with severe threat was again confined to the anxious group.

	abstract = {The present paper reports three new experiments suggesting that the valence of a face cue can influence attentional effects in a cueing paradigm. Moreover, heightened trait anxiety resulted in increased attentional dwell-time on emotional facial stimuli, relative to neutral faces. Experiment 1 presented a cueing task, in which the cue was either an "angry", "happy", or "neutral" facial expression. Targets could appear either in the same location as the face (valid trials) or in a different location to the face (invalid trials). Participants did not show significant variations across the different cue types (angry, happy, neutral) in responding to a target on valid trials. However, the valence of the face did affect response times on invalid trials. Specifically, participants took longer to respond to a target when the face cue was "angry" or "happy" relative to neutral. In Experiment 2, the cue-target stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) was increased and an overall inhibition of return (IOR) effect was found (i.e., slower responses on valid trials). However, the "angry" face cue eliminated the IOR effect for both high and low trait anxious groups. In Experiment 3, threat-related and jumbled facial stimuli reduced the magnitude of IOR for high, but not for low, trait-anxious participants.These results suggest that: (i) attentional bias in anxiety may reflect a difficulty in disengaging from threat-related and emotional stimuli, and (ii) threat-related and ambiguous cues can influence the magnitude of the IOR effect.},

	abstract = {A considerable volume of research has demonstrated an anxiety-linked attentional bias characterized by selective processing of threat stimuli. The last decade has seen growing interest in identifying the precise attentional mechanisms which underlie such selective processing to advance both theoretical and etiological models of anxiety. This research has particularly focused on the roles of spatial engagement and disengagement of attention. The relative contribution of these attentional components to selective processing of threat in anxious individuals remains unclear however. Moreover, we argue here that many of the tasks employed to examine these mechanisms, may not be capable of indexing the attentional processes that they claim to measure. In this article, we provide a methodological review, critically evaluating the adequacy of previous tasks employed to measure biased attentional engagement and disengagement. Based on a number of concerns raised about the ability of such tasks to differentiate these component attentional processes, we detail three task criteria that we believe are essential to be confident that a task will accurately index biased attentional engagement with, and disengagement from threat in anxious participants.},

	abstract = {Theoretical models of social phobia implicate preferential attention to social threat in the maintenance of anxiety symptoms, though there has been limited work characterizing the nature of these biases over time. The current study utilized eye-movement data to examine the time-course of visual attention over 1500ms trials of a probe detection task. Nineteen participants with a primary diagnosis of social phobia based on DSM-IV criteria and 20 non-clinical controls completed this task with angry, fearful, and happy face trials. Overt visual attention to the emotional and neutral faces was measured in 50ms segments across the trial. Over time, participants with social phobia attend less to emotional faces and specifically less to happy faces compared to controls. Further, attention to emotional relative to neutral expressions did not vary notably by emotion for participants with social phobia, but control participants showed a pattern after 1000ms in which over time they preferentially attended to happy expressions and avoided negative expressions. Findings highlight the importance of considering attention biases to positive stimuli as well as the pattern of attention between groups. These results suggest that attention "bias" in social phobia may be driven by a relative lack of the biases seen in non-anxious participants.},

After considering the purpose and nature of CBM methodologies, we show that variants designed to modify selective attention (CBM-A) or interpretation (CBM-I) have proven capable of reducing anxiety vulnerability and ameliorating dysfunctional anxiety. In addition to supporting the causal role of cognitive bias in anxiety vulnerability and dysfunction and illuminating the mechanisms that underpin such bias, the findings suggest that CBM procedures may have therapeutic promise within clinical settings. We discuss key issues within this burgeoning field of research and suggest future directions CBM research should take to maximize its theoretical and applied value.},

First, the results, which are traditionally summarized in an attentional bias index, do not allow for distinguishing between different selective attention processes; orienting and disengagement. Second, different versions of the dot probe task have been used with unknown relative merits. Participants (N=133) completed two versions of the dot probe task: the detection task (i.e. is there a probe?) and the differentiation task (i.e. what sort of probe is it?). The analysis carried out allowed for a differentiation between orienting and disengagement. The main finding was that trait anxiety is related to disengagement difficulties and not to speed of orienting. Concerning the relative merits of the two dot probe task versions, the results suggest that the detection task may be superior to the differentiation task.

	abstract = {The challenges in our personal, professional, financial, and emotional world are on rise, more so in developing countries and people will be longing for mental wellness for achieving complete health in their life. Resilience stands for one's capacity to recover from extremes of trauma and stress. Resilience in a person reflects a dynamic union of factors that encourages positive adaptation despite exposure to adverse life experiences. One needs to have a three-dimensional construct for understanding resilience as a state (what is it and how does one identify it?), a condition (what can be done about it?), and a practice (how does one get there?). Evaluating the level of resilience requires the measurement of internal (personal) and external (environmental) factors, taking into account that family and social environment variables of resilience play very important roles in an individual's resilience. Protection factors seem to be more important in the development of resilience than risk factors. Resilience is a process that lasts a lifetime, with periods of acquisition and maintenance, and reduction and loss for assessment. Overall, currently available data on resilience suggest the presence of a neurobiological substrate, based largely on genetics, which correlates with personality traits, some of which are configured via social learning. The major questions about resilience revolve around properly defining the concept, identifying the factors involved in its development and recognizing whether it is actually possible to immunize mental health against adversities. In the clinical field, it may be possible to identify predisposing factors or risk factors for psychopathologies and to develop new intervention strategies, both preventive and therapeutic, based on the concept of resilience. The preferred environments for application of resilience are health, education, and social policy and the right approach in integrating; it can be developed only with more research and analysis with focus on resilience. Be it patient or family member or caregiver, advocating resilience will empower psychiatrists in India.},

Positive emotions predicted increases in both resilience and life satisfaction. Negative emotions had weak or null effects and did not interfere with the benefits of positive emotions. Positive emotions also mediated the relation between baseline and final resilience, but life satisfaction did not. This suggests that it is in-the-moment positive emotions, and not more general positive evaluations of one's life, that form the link between happiness and desirable life outcomes. Change in resilience mediated the relation between positive emotions and increased life satisfaction, suggesting that happy people become more satisfied not simply because they feel better but because they develop resources for living well.},

Recent studies in animal models suggest that the degree to which one is able to control an aversive experience is a critical factor determining its behavioral consequences. In this study, we examined whether stressor controllability modulates subsequent conditioned fear expression in humans. Participants were randomly assigned to an escapable stressor condition, a yoked inescapable stressor condition, or a control condition involving no stress exposure. One week later, all participants underwent fear conditioning, fear extinction, and a test of extinction retrieval the following day. Participants exposed to inescapable stress showed impaired fear extinction learning and increased fear expression the following day. In contrast, escapable stress improved fear extinction and prevented the spontaneous recovery of fear. Consistent with the bidirectional controllability effects previously reported in animal models, these results suggest that one's degree of control over aversive experiences may be an important factor influencing the development of psychological resilience or vulnerability in humans. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Clinical evidence suggests that a persistent search for solutions for chronic pain may bring along costs at the cognitive, affective, and behavioral level. Specifically, attempts to control pain may fuel hypervigilance and prioritize attention towards pain-related information. This hypothesis was investigated in an experiment with 41 healthy volunteers. Prioritization of attention towards a signal for pain was measured using an adaptation of a visual search paradigm in which participants had to search for a target presented in a varying number of colored circles. One of these colors (Conditioned Stimulus) became a signal for pain (Unconditioned Stimulus: electrocutaneous stimulus at tolerance level) using a classical conditioning procedure. Intermixed with the visual search task, participants also performed another task. In the pain-control group, participants were informed that correct and fast responses on trials of this second task would result in an avoidance of the Unconditioned Stimulus. In the comparison group, performance on the second task was not instrumental in controlling pain. Results showed that in the pain-control group, attention was more prioritized towards the Conditioned Stimulus than in the comparison group. The theoretical and clinical implications of these results are discussed. Using a visual search task, we showed that the goal to avoid pain leads to enhanced prioritization of signals of pain. ?? 2011 International Association for the Study of Pain.

Design/methodology/approach ‚Äì A literature review of the last two decades was undertaken and pathways to complete mental health in recovery are proposed. Findings ‚Äì More work is needed to further develop interventions oriented towards the promotion of positive mental health in recovery, targeting the enhancement of positive emotions towards life and a sense of fulfillment in private and social life. Positive mental health also deserves more research attention to assess the full range of recovery outcomes related to the restoration and optimization processes. A better understanding of individual and environmental factors facilitating or hindering the achievement of complete mental health in recovery is warranted as well. Originality/value ‚Äì Unlike previous conceptions, the model presented in the paper proposes to redefine recovery from the complete view of mental health and introduces positive mental health as an additional outcome of recovery.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Acute administration of an antidepressant increases positive affective processing in healthy volunteers, an effect that may be relevant to the therapeutic actions of these medications. The authors investigated whether this effect is apparent in depressed patients early in treatment, prior to changes in mood and symptoms. METHOD: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, between-groups randomized design, the authors examined the effect of a single 4-mg dose of the norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor reboxetine on emotional processing. Thirty-three depressed patients were recruited through primary care clinics and the community and matched to 31 healthy comparison subjects. Three hours after dosing, participants were given a battery of emotional processing tasks comprising facial expression recognition, emotional categorization, and memory. Ratings of mood, anxiety, and side effects were also obtained before and after treatment. RESULTS: Depressed patients who received placebo showed reduced recognition of positive facial expressions, decreased speed in responding to positive self-relevant personality adjectives, and reduced memory for this positive information compared to healthy volunteers receiving placebo. However, this effect was reversed in patients who received a single dose of reboxetine, despite the absence of changes in subjective ratings of mood or anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Antidepressant drug administration modulates emotional processing in depressed patients very early in treatment, before changes occur in mood and symptoms. This effect may ameliorate the negative biases in information processing that characterize mood and anxiety disorders. It also suggests a mechanism of action compatible with cognitive theories of depression.},

Then, the origins of cognitive distortions in anxious children and adolescents are addressed with reference to genetic-based vulnerability, environmental influence, and gene-environment interactions. Finally, the article provides a critical discussion of the developmental aspects of cognitive distortions, their precise role in the aetiology and maintenance of childhood anxiety disorders, and their relevance for the treatment of this type of psychopathology.

In the present study, participants were required to switch between two randomly ordered spatial location tasks in which the position of a target within a 2 ?? 2 grid was determined according to a horizontal or vertical dimension. The typical congruency effect in task switching was replicated such that interference from a currently irrelevant task was associated with slower and inaccurate responses for a currently relevant task. High-ruminators, compared with low-ruminators, displayed poor filtering of the currently irrelevant task which in turn resulted in a specific task selection deficit, and a tendency to perform the irrelevant task. Results suggest that an impaired ability in selecting the appropriate task promoted application of the most salient task regardless of relevance. Our findings extend previous research linking impaired inhibition of irrelevant information with cognitive inflexibility in dysphoric rumination, and argue for an independent contribution of dysphoric rumination to cognitive deficits observed in dysphoria. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Background and objectives Dysfunctional cognitions are known to emerge in stressful situations and are critical for the onset of depressive symptoms. The goal of this study is to investigate whether adaptive and/or maladaptive emotion regulation strategies moderate the relationship between dysfunctional attitudes and depressive symptoms under stress. Methods In a longitudinal study, 92 healthy but unselected undergraduates were followed for three months including a stress period (four weeks of examinations). Results Our findings demonstrate that the more adaptive emotion regulation strategies are used in daily life (measured at baseline), the weaker the relationship between dysfunctional attitudes and depressive symptoms during stress. Interestingly, no single strategy demonstrates a unique predictive value, but only the combination of several adaptive strategies moderates the relationship between dysfunctional attitudes and depressive symptoms. Although participants with elevated depressive symptoms use more maladaptive emotion regulation strategies, these latter strategies do not moderate the association between dysfunctional attitudes and depressive symptoms. Limitations The use of a sample of undergraduates limits the generalizability and the clinical significance of our results. Conclusions Altogether, although dysfunctional attitudes are activated and accessible in response to certain life stressors, the strategies that healthy individuals use to adaptively regulate these cognitions seem important in determining the likelihood of depressive symptoms.??2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Questions about the neural bases of emotion regulation have recently taken on new importance, as functional imaging studies in humans have permitted direct investigation of control strategies that draw upon higher cognitive processes difficult to study in nonhumans. Such studies have examined (1) controlling attention to, and (2) cognitively changing the meaning of, emotionally evocative stimuli. These two forms of emotion regulation depend upon interactions between prefrontal and cingulate control systems and cortical and subcortical emotion-generative systems. Taken together, the results suggest a functional architecture for the cognitive control of emotion that dovetails with findings from other human and nonhuman research on emotion. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, this study aimed to examine whether a specific cognitive control mechanism that directs attention between self-generated thoughts and external information might moderate the relationship between dysphoria and maladaptive self-referential thinking. Results showed that dysphoria increases the frequency of rumination, self-blame, and catastrophising, especially for participants who have more difficulty in switching from self-generated thoughts to information provided by the environment. These results shed new light on the cognitive mechanisms underlying maladaptive self-referential thinking associated with dysphoria.

To organise emerging findings, we present a dual-process framework that integrates explicit and implicit forms of emotion regulation, and argue that both forms of regulation are necessary for well-being. In the first section of this review, we provide a broad overview of the construct of emotion regulation, with an emphasis on explicit and implicit processes. In the second section, we focus on explicit emotion regulation, considering both neural mechanisms that are associated with these processes and their experiential and physiological consequences. In the third section, we turn to several forms of implicit emotion regulation, and integrate the burgeoning literature in this area. We conclude by outlining open questions and areas for future research.},

Although WM capacity has been viewed as a constant trait, recent studies suggest that it can be improved by adaptive and extended training. This training is associated with changes in brain activity in frontal and parietal cortex and basal ganglia, as well as changes in dopamine receptor density. Transfer of the training effects to non-trained WM tasks is consistent with the notion of training-induced plasticity in a common neural network for WM. The observed training effects suggest that WM training could be used as a remediating intervention for individuals for whom low WM capacity is a limiting factor for academic performance or in everyday life. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Working memory training using the adaptive dual n- back task has shown to improve attentional control in subclinical depression with transfer effects at the behavioral and neural level on a working memory task (Owens, Koster \& Derakshan, 2013). Here, we examined the beneficial effects of working memory training on attentional control in pre-selected high trait anxious individuals who underwent a three week daily training intervention using the adaptive dual n-back task. Pre and post outcome measures of attentional control were assessed using a Flanker task that included a stress induction and an emotional Antisaccade task (with angry and neutral faces as target). Resting state EEG (Theta/Beta ratio) was recorded to as a neural marker of trait attentional control. Our results showed that adaptive working memory training improved attentional control with transfer effects on the Flanker task and resting state EEG, but effects of training on the Antisaccade task were less conclusive. Finally, training related gains were associated with lower levels of trait anxiety at post (vs pre) intervention. Our results demonstrate that adaptive working memory training in anxiety can have beneficial effects on attentional control and cognitive performance that may protect against emotional vulnerability in individuals at risk of developing clinical anxiety.},

Three age groups (8-10; 18-26; 62-76 years of age) were examined in a pretest-training-posttest design. We found near transfer of task-switching training in all age groups, especially in children and older adults. Near transfer was enhanced in adults and impaired in children when training tasks were variable. We also found substantial far transfer to other executive tasks and fluid intelligence in all age groups, pointing to the transfer of relatively general executive control abilities after training.},

Previous research suggests that the experience of positive emotion momentarily broadens cognitive processes, potentially allowing individuals to build an array of enduring personal resources. However, it is unknown whether the experience of positive emotion also broadens emotional information processing. Participants included 60 healthy undergraduate students who completed measures of psychopathology, self-reported emotional experience, and an emotional Stroop task designed to measure attentional bias to positive and negative emotional information. Results indicate significant associations between reaction times for high-intensity happiness words and self-reported high levels of positive emotion and low levels of negative emotions. These associations were not present for low intensity happiness words. Findings suggest that individuals who experience high levels of positive emotion and low levels of negative emotion demonstrate an attention bias for positive information and, from an information processing perspective, provide insight into the manner in which positive emotions broaden cognitive processes.

	abstract = {Fluid intelligence (Gf) refers to the ability to reason and to solve new problems independently of previously acquired knowledge. Gf is critical for a wide variety of cognitive tasks, and it is considered one of the most important factors in learning. Moreover, Gf is closely related to professional and educational success, especially in complex and demanding environments. Although performance on tests of Gf can be improved through direct practice on the tests themselves, there is no evidence that training on any other regimen yields increased Gf in adults. Furthermore, there is a long history of research into cognitive training showing that, although performance on trained tasks can increase dramatically, transfer of this learning to other tasks remains poor. Here, we present evidence for transfer from training on a demanding working memory task to measures of Gf. This transfer results even though the trained task is entirely different from the intelligence test itself. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the extent of gain in intelligence critically depends on the amount of training: the more training, the more improvement in Gf. That is, the training effect is dosage-dependent. Thus, in contrast to many previous studies, we conclude that it is possible to improve Gf without practicing the testing tasks themselves, opening a wide range of applications.},

Prioritized processing of affective stimulus content may enhance accessibility of affective task-sets and generate increased interference when switching between affective and non-affective task-sets. Previous research has demonstrated that more dominant task-sets experience greater switch costs, as they necessitate active inhibition during performance of less entrenched tasks. Extending this logic to the affective domain, the present experiment examined (a) whether affective task-sets are more dominant than non-affective ones, and (b) what neural mechanisms regulate affective task-sets, so that weaker, non-affective task-sets can be executed. While undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging, participants categorized face stimuli according to either their gender (non-affective task) or their emotional expression (affective task). Behavioral results were consistent with the affective task dominance hypothesis: participants were slower to switch to the affective task, and cross-task interference was strongest when participants tried to switch from the affective to the non-affective task. These behavioral costs of controlling the affective task-set were mirrored in the activation of a right-lateralized frontostriatal network previously implicated in task-set updating and response inhibition. Connectivity between amygdala and right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex was especially pronounced during cross-task interference from affective features.},

	abstract = {Whether positive mood can change reinforcement learning or not remains an open question. In this study, we used a probabilistic learning task and explored whether positive mood could alter the way positive versus negative feedback was used to guide learning. This process was characterized both at the behavioral and electro-encephalographic levels. Thirty two participants were randomly allocated either to a positive or a neutral (control) mood condition. Behavioral results showed that while learning performance was balanced between the two groups, participants in the positive mood group had a higher learning rate than participants in the neutral mood group. At the electrophysiological level, we found that positive mood increased the error-related negativity when the stimulus-response associations were deterministic, selectively (as opposed to random or probabilistic). However, it did not influence the feedback-related negativity. These new findings are discussed in terms of an enhanced internal reward prediction error signal after the induction of positive mood when the probability of getting a reward is high.},

Within this article, we (1) systematically review prospective and experimental research exploring ABs and pain outcomes in light of current theoretical models and (2) propose a theoretical framework for understanding AB in pain. Across prospective research, an attentional pattern of vigilance‚Äìavoidance was observed. Interventions targeting ABs were less consistent; however, there were promising findings among studies that found attentional training effects, particularly for laboratory research. The proposed Threat Interpretation Model suggests a relationship between threat, interpretation, and stimuli in determining attentional processes, which while tentative generates important testable predictions regarding the role of attention in pain and builds on previous theoretical and empirical work in this area.},

We combined 241 effect sizes from 114 studies that examined the relationships between dispositional emotion regulation and psychopathology. We focused on dispositional emotion regulation in order to assess patterns of responding to emotion over time. First, we examined the relationship between each regulatory strategy and psychopathology across the four disorders. We found a large effect size for rumination, medium to large for avoidance, problem solving, and suppression, and small to medium for reappraisal and acceptance. These results are surprising, given the prominence of reappraisal and acceptance in treatment models, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and acceptance-based treatments, respectively. Second, we examined the relationship between each regulatory strategy and each of the four psychopathology groups. We found that internalizing disorders were more consistently associated with regulatory strategies than externalizing disorders. Lastly, many of our analyses showed that whether the sample came from a clinical or normative population significantly moderated the relationships. This finding underscores the importance of adopting a multi-sample approach to the study of psychopathology. ¬© 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Attention Bias Modification Treatment (ABMT) is a newly emerging, promising treatment for anxiety disorders. Although recent randomized control trials (RCTs) suggest that ABMT reduces anxiety, therapeutic effects have not been summarized quantitatively.

METHODS: Standard meta-analytic procedures were used to summarize the effect of ABMT on anxiety. With MEDLINE, January 1995 to February 2010, we identified RCTs comparing the effects on anxiety of ABMT and quantified effect sizes with Hedge's d.

RESULTS: Twelve studies met inclusion criteria, including 467 participants from 10 publications. Attention Bias Modification Treatment produced significantly greater reductions in anxiety than control training, with a medium effect (d = .51 [corrected] (p {\textless} .001). Age and gender did not moderate the effect of ABMT on anxiety, whereas several characteristics of the ABMT training did.

CONCLUSIONS: Attention Bias Modification Treatment shows promise as a novel treatment for anxiety. Additional RCTs are needed to fully evaluate the degree to which these findings replicate and apply to patients. Future work should consider the precise role for ABMT in the broader anxiety-disorder therapeutic armamentarium.},

	abstract = {Attention bias modification (ABM) protocols aim to modify attentional biases underlying many forms of pathology. Our objective was to conduct an effect size analysis of ABM across a wide range of samples and psychological problems. We conducted a literature search using PubMed, PsycInfo, and author searches to identify randomized studies that examined the effects of ABM on attention and subjective experiences. We identified 37 studies (41 experiments) totaling 2,135 participants who were randomized to training toward neutral, positive, threat, or appetitive stimuli or to a control condition. The effect size estimate for changes in attentional bias was large for the neutral versus threat comparisons (g=1.06), neutral versus appetitive (g=1.41), and neutral versus control comparisons (g=0.80), and small for positive versus control (g=0.24). The effects of ABM on attention bias were moderated by stimulus type (words vs. pictures) and sample characteristics (healthy vs. high symptomatology). Effect sizes of ABM on subjective experiences ranged from 0.03 to 0.60 for postchallenge outcomes, -0.31 to 0.51 for posttreatment, and were moderated by number of training sessions, stimulus type, and stimulus orientation (top/bottom vs. left/right). Fail-safe N calculations suggested that the effect size estimates were robust for the training effects on attentional biases, but not for the effect on subjective experiences. ABM studies using threat stimuli produced significant effects on attention bias across comparison conditions, whereas appetitive stimuli produced changes in attention only when comparing appetitive versus neutral conditions. ABM has a moderate and robust effect on attention bias when using threat stimuli. Further studies are needed to determine whether these effects are also robust when using appetitive stimuli and for affecting subjective experiences. ¬© 2012.},

Inclusion criteria were as follows: AB was specifically targeted to reduce symptomatology and emotional vulnerability; participants were randomized to the experimental conditions; a control condition (defined as sham training) existed; symptoms were assessed at least postintervention; sufficient data were provided to allow effect size estimation.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: We obtained a small overall effect size on symptoms postintervention, g = 0.160, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = [0.055, 0.265], driven by anxiety studies, g = 0.260, 95\% CI = [0.132, 0.388], and studies conducted in healthy participants, g = 0.211, 95\% CI = [0.046, 0.375]; no significant effect sizes were found postintervention for other symptom categories.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSION: The therapeutic benefit of ABM is rather small for anxiety, while the amount of data for other symptom categories is limited. We argue that more efficient, psychometrically sound procedures are needed for assessing and modifying AB.},

In this meta-analysis, we assessed the efficacy of ABM for SAD on symptoms, reactivity to speech challenge, attentional bias (AB) toward threat, and secondary symptoms at posttraining as well as SAD symptoms at 4-month follow-up. A systematic search in bibliographical databases uncovered 15 randomized studies involving 1043 individuals that compared ABM to a control training procedure. Data were extracted independently by two raters. The Q statistic was used to assess homogeneity across trials. All analyses were conducted on intent-to-treat data. ABM produced a small but significant reduction in SAD symptoms (g=0.27), reactivity to speech challenge (g=0.46), and AB (g=0.30). These effects were moderated by characteristics of the ABM procedure, the design of the study, and trait anxiety at baseline. However, effects on secondary symptoms (g=0.09) and SAD symptoms at 4-month follow-up (g=0.09) were not significant. Although there was no indication of significant publication bias, the quality of the studies was substandard and wedged the effect sizes. From a clinical point of view, these findings imply that ABM is not yet ready for wide-scale dissemination as a treatment for SAD in routine care. Theoretical implications for the integration of AB in the conceptualization of SAD are discussed.},

This ability is suggested to be mediated by the con-24 nectivity between prefrontal brain regions and the amygdala. Yet, it is still unknown whether the ability to regulate 25 emotions can be trained by using a non-emotional procedure, such as the recruitment of executive control (EC). 26 Participants who were trained using a high-frequent executive control (EC) task (80\% incongruent trials) showed 27 reduced amygdala reactivity and behavioral interference of aversive pictures. These effects were observed only 28 following multiple-session training and not following one training session. In addition, they were not observed 29 for participants exposed to low-frequent EC training (20\% incongruent trials). Resting-state functional connectiv-30 ity analysis revealed a marginally significant interaction between training groups and change in the connectivity 31 between the amygdala and the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Amygdala‚ÄìIFG connectivity was significantly 32 increased following the training only in the high-frequent EC training group. These findings are the first to 33 show that non-emotional training can induce changes in amygdala reactivity to aversive information and alter 34 amygdala‚Äìprefrontal connectivity. Excessive emotional arousal can impair individuals' ability to 42 achieve their goals (Ochsner et al., 2002). This is especially true when 43 heightened arousal emerges from an encounter with task-irrelevant 44 emotional stimuli. Although emotional processing was considered auto-45 matic for many years (√ñhman et al., 2001), the prevalent notion among 46 emotion scientists today posits that emotions can be down-regulated 47 using voluntary (Goldin et al., 2008; Ochsner and Gross, 2008) and 48 involuntary (Dolcos et al., 2006; Okon-Singer et al., 2007; van Dillen 49 et al., 2009) emotion regulation strategies. These regulation mecha-50 nisms are associated with enhanced activation in prefrontal regions 51 such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the dorsolateral prefrontal 52 cortex (DLPFC), and the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and reduced 53 activation in the amygdala, a key region in emotional processing 54 (Dolcos et al., 2006; Iordan et al., 2013; Q4 Okon-Singer et al., 2014; Van 55 Dillen et al., 2009; see reviews in Okon-Singer et al., 2013, 2015). 56 Importantly, the same prefrontal regions that are activated during 57 emotion regulation tasks are also activated in tasks that recruit executive 58 control (EC) (Aron et al., 2004; Fan et al., 2005; MacDonald et al., 2000). 59 EC is a high-order cognitive operation that enables goal-directed behav-60 ior by suppressing irrelevant distraction (Banich, 2009; Fan et al., 2002; 61 Miller and Cohen, 2001). Several studies reported that EC plays a role 62 also in suppressing irrelevant emotional information (Blair et al., 2007; 63 Cohen et al., 2011, 2012) and that there are functional and anatomical 64 connections between EC-related regions and the amygdala (Quirk and 65 Beer, 2006; Rohr et al., 2015; Roy et al., 2009). Thus, the inverse link 66 between activation in prefrontal regions and the amygdala may be 67 explained by EC activation. 68 Indeed, behavioral findings indicate that EC-based training can re-69 duce emotional distraction and emotion dysregulation symptomatology 70 (Cohen et al., 2015a, 2015b; Daches and Mor, 2014; Schweizer et al., 71 2011, 2013; Siegle et al., 2007).

These control functions are supported by the prefrontal cortex and therefore develop rapidly across childhood and mature well into late adolescence. Given that executive control is a strong predictor for various life outcomes, such as academic achievement, socioeconomic status, and physical health, numerous training interventions have been designed to improve executive functioning across the lifespan, many of them targeting children and adolescents. Despite the increasing popularity of these trainings, their results are neither robust nor consistent, and the transferability of training-induced performance improvements to untrained tasks seems to be limited. In this review, we provide a selective overview of the developmental literature on process-based cognitive interventions by discussing (1) the concept and the development of EFs and their neural underpinnings, (2) the effects of different types of executive control training in normally developing children and adolescents, (3) individual differences in training-related performance gains as well as (4) the potential of cognitive training interventions for the application in clinical and educational contexts.

This is reflected in the popularity of the diathesis-stress framework, which has received a vast amount of empirical support over the years. Much less effort has been directed toward the investigation of endogenous factors associated with variability in response to positive influences. One reason for the failure to investigate individual differences in response to positive experiences as a function of endogenous factors may be the absence of adequate theoretical frameworks. According to the differential-susceptibility hypothesis, individuals generally vary in their developmental plasticity regardless of whether they are exposed to negative or positive influences--a notion derived from evolutionary reasoning. On the basis of this now well-supported proposition, we advance herein the new concept of vantage sensitivity, reflecting variation in response to exclusively positive experiences as a function of individual endogenous characteristics. After distinguishing vantage sensitivity from theoretically related concepts of differential-susceptibility and resilience, we review some recent empirical evidence for vantage sensitivity featuring behavioral, physiological, and genetic factors as moderators of a wide range of positive experiences ranging from family environment and psychotherapy to educational intervention. Thereafter, we discuss genetic and environmental factors contributing to individual differences in vantage sensitivity, potential mechanisms underlying vantage sensitivity, and practical implications.},

We argue that the health benefits advanced by positive emotions may be instantiated in certain traits that are characterized by the experience of positive emotion. Towards this end, we examine individual differences in psychological resilience (the ability to bounce back from negative events by using positive emotions to cope) and positive emotional granularity (the tendency to represent experiences of positive emotion with precision and specificity). Individual differences in these traits are examined in two studies, one using psychophysiological evidence, the second using evidence from experience sampling, to demonstrate that positive emotions play a crucial role in enhancing coping resources in the face of negative events.

Fredrickson's (1998, 2001) broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions asserts that people's daily experiences of positive emotions compound over time to build a variety of consequential personal resources. The authors tested this build hypothesis in a field experiment with working adults (n = 139), half of whom were randomly-assigned to begin a practice of loving-kindness meditation. Results showed that this meditation practice produced increases over time in daily experiences of positive emotions, which, in turn, produced increases in a wide range of personal resources (e.g., increased mindfulness, purpose in life, social support, decreased illness symptoms). In turn, these increments in personal resources predicted increased life satisfaction and reduced depressive symptoms. Discussion centers on how positive emotions are the mechanism of change for the type of mind-training practice studied here and how loving-kindness meditation is an intervention strategy that produces positive emotions in a way that outpaces the hedonic treadmill effect.},

	abstract = {Although the cognitive model of depression has evolved appreciably since its first formulation over 40 years ago, the potential interaction of genetic, neurochemical, and cognitive factors has only recently been demonstrated. Combining findings from behavioral genetics and cognitive neuroscience with the accumulated research on the cognitive model opens new opportunities for integrated research. Drawing on advances in cognitive, personality, and social psychology as well as clinical observations, expansions of the original cognitive model have incorporated in successive stages automatic thoughts, cognitive distortions, dysfunctional beliefs, and information-processing biases. The developmental model identified early traumatic experiences and the formation of dysfunctional beliefs as predisposing events and congruent stressors in later life as precipitating factors. It is now possible to sketch out possible genetic and neurochemical pathways that interact with or are parallel to cognitive variables. A hypersensitive amygdala is associated with both a genetic polymorphism and a pattern of negative cognitive biases and dysfunctional beliefs, all of which constitute risk factors for depression. Further, the combination of a hyperactive amygdala and hypoactive prefrontal regions is associated with diminished cognitive appraisal and the occurrence of depression. Genetic polymorphisms also are involved in the overreaction to the stress and the hypercortisolemia in the development of depression--probably mediated by cognitive distortions. I suggest that comprehensive study of the psychological as well as biological correlates of depression can provide a new understanding of this debilitating disorder.},

A popular notion emerging from this work states that a relative immaturity in frontal cortical neural systems could explain adolescents' high rates of risk-taking, substance use and other dangerous behaviours. However, developmental neuroimaging studies do not support a simple model of frontal cortical immaturity. Rather, growing evidence points to the importance of changes in social and affective processing, which begin around the onset of puberty, as crucial to understanding these adolescent vulnerabilities. These changes in social-affective processing also may confer some adaptive advantages, such as greater flexibility in adjusting one's intrinsic motivations and goal priorities amidst changing social contexts in adolescence.},

Yet, cardiac responses might also be affected by emotions that are not consciously reported. Here we tested this hypothesis. Sixty participants were randomly allocated to an evaluated speaking stressor or control condition. Trait, state and implicit anxiety were assessed with the State Trait Anxiety Inventory, visual analog scales and the Implicit Association Test for assessing anxiety, with the latter two assessed before and after the stressor. Results showed that the stressor did not significantly affect implicit anxiety. Yet, participants with high implicit anxiety after the stressor had an overall enhanced heart rate and larger stressor-induced decreases in heart rate variability. These associations were independent of conscious anxiety. The implications of the results for a better understanding of excessive cardiac activity are discussed. ¬© 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

These are some fair points that it will be worth exploring within my study 3 write up and design, including the idea of this paper that there are implicit emotional responses that affect cardiovascular responses to stress(note on p. 1)
Look into the costings of these pieces of equipment(note on p. 2)
This is a pretty awesome summary of the importance of multilevel modelling for repeated measures tasks such as this(note on p. 3)},
	annote = {This study is similar in some respects to my study 3. In particular,they use continuous measures of cardiac activity before, during, and after a stressor. 

As an aside, it may be worth trying to sort out a heart rate monitor that I can use in my study 3 as a physiological measure. 

Is there an IAT-Stress that might also work?

Viausl analogue scales used here, I will likely use similar ratings between blocks in my third study.


Note that this study failed to assess implicit processing during the stressor, a limitation held by many studies which my study 3 seeks to address.


Verkuil, Brosschot, \& Thayer (2014) examined the potential associations between implicit anxiety (using the IAT-Anxiety) and cardiac reactivity to a stress induction (The interview part of the Trier Social Stress Test: TSST). Cardiac reactvity was examined at baseline, during an anticipatory phase, during the speech, and during recovery 5 minutes after the speech. The main finding was that while the stressor did not significantly impact implicit anxiety, participants with high implicit anxiety during recovery had enhanced heart rate and larger decreases in HRV (independent of conscious anxiety). The results suggest that implicit anxiety has some association with cardiac activity in recovery from a stressor.

There are some limitations that have relavance to my proposed study 3. First, the sudy did not examine information processing during the stressor. While state anxiety and implicit anxiety was examined just after, and cardiac activity was examined at all points, a stronger argument for the involvement of implicit emotion processing on cardiac reactivity would be an examiniation of the information processing during the stress induction, perhaps in conjunction with measuring cardiac activity. The inclusion of both explicit and implicit measures of anxiety is to be commended however, as a useful addition to this area of research and an underutlised one. Usually only an explicit measure is used.

The authors conclde that implicit measures of anxiety are potentiallyvaluable in contributing to understanding of excessive cardiac activity. Which is a great part of my study 3 rationale.},

Unfortunately the sample sizes were small, which may account for some of the non-significant differences/correlations. However, the correlations tended to be of a good size, suggesting that a big part of the issue is that more participants were needed.

Good clarification of the difference between rumination and worry. Rumination refers to repetitive and passive thinking about ones mood and consequences, whereas worry has been defined as a chain of thoughts and images, negtively affect-laden and relatively incontrollable. Worry is typically future oriented, whereas rumination is oriented towards past events and failures.

However, neither the way in which serotonin may alleviate depressed mood nor the reason why several weeks needs to elapse before the full antidepressant effect of treatment is expressed is known. Here, we propose a neuropsychological theory of SSRI antidepressant action based on the ability of SSRIs to produce positive biases in the processing of emotional information. Both behavioural and neuroimaging studies show that SSRI administration produces positive biases in attention, appraisal and memory from the earliest stages of treatment, well before the time that clinical improvement in mood becomes apparent. We suggest that the delay in the clinical effect of SSRIs can be explained by the time needed for this positive bias in implicit emotional processing to become apparent at a subjective, conscious level. This process is likely to involve the re-learning of emotional associations in a new, more positive emotional environment. This suggests intriguing links between the effect of SSRIs to promote synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis, and their ability to remediate negative emotional biases in depressed patients.},

In addition, this is modulated by anxiety, such that more anxious participants were more likely to invest in risk avoidance only when risk everity increased and there were no differences in increased risk liklihood. Though the interac5tion between severity and liklihood was more important for more anxious individuals. 

The authors raise the possibility that heightened anxiety may drive adaptive responding to threat, however, clinical levels of anxiety only serve to impair performance - but further testing with a clinically anxious group would help to demonstrate this.

Study 1 - heightened ruminative disposition was charactersied by increased negative expectency bias, reflecting an inflated self-reported expectency for negative events relative to positive events. However, there was no evidence that rumination associated with emotional extrapoloation of inferences from the outcome of the first event to the subsequent event.

Study 2 extended the task into a performance-bbased, rather than self-report measure (first time done). This allowed the researchers to probe the emotional extrapolation hypothesis more fully. In this study, contrary to study 1; higher rumination scores were associated with heightened tendency to engage in emotional extrapolation but a general self-reported negative expectency bias was not observed. 


excellent quote "it is our own view that when self-report measures and performance-measures of a cognitive process disagree, then it is prudent to have greater faith in the latter" p655 (also see Nisbett \& Wilson, 1977).

They also offer the theoretical position that elevated ruminative disposition may not be universally maladaptive. it may simply be a mechanism that inflates the emotional impact of current events byy increasing the percieved liklihood that similar future events will be of similar valence. The elevated extrapolation may become maladaptive when combined with more negative events for example, or even in combination with negative processing biases.},

	abstract = {A lack of behavioural engagement in health promotion or disease prevention is a problem across many health domains. In these cases where people face a genuine danger, a reduced focus on threat and low levels of anxiety or worry are maladaptive in terms of promoting protection or prevention behaviour. Therefore, it is possible that increasing the processing of threat will increase worry and thereby enhance engagement in adaptive behaviour. Laboratory studies have shown that cognitive bias modification (CBM) can increase or decrease anxiety and worry when increased versus decreased processing of threat is encouraged. In the current study, CBM for interpretation (CBM-I) is used to target engagement in sun protection behaviour. The goal was to investigate whether inducing a negative rather than a positive interpretation bias for physical threat information can enhance worry elicited when viewing a health campaign video (warning against melanoma skin cancer), and consequently lead to more adaptive behaviour (sun protection). Participants were successfully trained to either adopt a positive or negative interpretation bias using physical threat scenarios. However, contrary to expectations results showed that participants in the positive training condition reported higher levels of worry elicited by the melanoma video than participants in the negative training condition. Video elicited worry was, however, positively correlated with a measure of engagement in sun protection behaviour, suggesting that higher levels of worry do promote adaptive behaviour. These findings imply that more research is needed to determine under which conditions increased versus decreased processing of threat can drive adaptive worry. Various potential explanations for the current findings and suggestions for future research are discussed.},

This raises interesting thoughts regarding the context-specificity of processing biases - a la certain biases are beneficial in certain circumstances.


The study induced a positive interpretation bias in half of the participants, and a negative interpretation bias in the other half (and demonstrated that they sig. differed in bias).

Contrary to predictions, the positive training group reported higher levels of worry in response to the melanoma video than the negative training. Larger increases in worry were associated with more engagement in protection in the lost luggage game.


The authors suggest that it is possible that the type of worry might be important. Prior research showing lower worry following positive CBM-I measured things like thought intrusions - whereas this study measured highly relevant worry given the context, as opposed to the maladaptive task-irrelevant rumination for example.},

In this article, a simple system for measuring timing accuracy is described. The system uses two PCs (at least Pentium II, 200 MHz), a photocell, and an amplifier. No additional boards and timing hardware are needed. The first PC, a SlavePC, monitors the keyboard presses or mouse signals from the PC under test and uses a photocell that is placed in front of the screen to detect the appearance of visual stimuli on the display. The software consists of a small program running on the SlavePC. The SlavePC is connected through a serial line with a second PC. This MasterPC controls the SlavePC through an ActiveX control, which is used in a Visual Basic program. The accuracy of our system was investigated by using a similar setup of a SlavePC and a MasterPC to generate pulses and by using a pulse generator card. These tests revealed that our system has a 0.01-msec accuracy. As an illustration, the reaction time accuracy of INQUISIT for a few applications was tested using our system. It was found that in those applications that we investigated, INQUISIT measures reaction times from keyboard presses with millisecond accuracy.},

They make several important points, some of which are quoted below. The point is made that there are a number of stressors and resilience is not universal to every stressor - it is a highly dynamic process and not a trait measure. A multidisciplicary approach is needed to elucidate the mechanisms and causal pathways through which individuals show resilience or adversity in the face of adversity. ( also note that resilience is therefore not an outcome)

The authors point out that an individual should not only be considered resilient if they have relatively positive outcomes across all domains of functioning.

"resilience is not simply a trait that can be measured directly" - this is awesome.

also 
"It is the complex interplay between the individual and their environment that will be key to understanding processes of resilience."

Several important factors to consider are the nature and timing of the stressor, the degree to which it may be "controllable" and the psychiatric outcome in question.

The authors also highlight the need for resilience studies to use a longitudinal approach


"While there is a large body of research focusing on the mechanisms by which risky environments ‚Äò‚Äòget under the skin‚Äô‚Äô to increase vulnerabil-ity to psychopathology, very little is known about the mechan-isms by which positive, socially supportive environments ‚Äò‚Äòget under the skin‚Äô‚Äô to promote resilience."},

This literature falls short of addressing whether the effects of CBM-I extend to worries about a real-life stressor, such as a school transition. DESIGN: The study comprised a between-groups design comparing the effects of CBM-I to an active control (AC) intervention in children. METHOD: We recruited 38 children within two months of their primary-secondary school transition and investigated the capacity for multi-session, parent-administered CBM-I, compared to an AC condition, to modify cognitive style and reduce anxiety symptoms and school concerns. RESULTS: While benign interpretations increased significantly and negative interpretations tended to decrease following CBM-I, both interventions significantly reduced anxiety symptoms and school concerns. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that anxiety-reducing effects of CBM-I in children extend to a real life stressful event, but that equivalent anxiety reduction may be achieved through exposure to potentially worrying situations and parent-child interaction in the absence of bias modification.},

Participants of European-American descent (N = 2,246) were included from three large treatment studies of bipolar disorder (STEP-BD) (N = 765), major depressive disorder (STAR*D) (N = 1091), and schizophrenia (CATIE) (N = 390).

Psychiatric symptom severity was a significant predictor of functional impairment, but it accounted for less than one-third of the variance across disorders. After controlling for diagnostic category and symptom severity, the strongest evidence of genetic association was between variants in ADAMTS16 and physical functioning (P = 5.87 √ó 10(-8) ).

Recently reported genetic association studies indicate that these effects may be mediated, in part, by genexenvironment interactions involving polymorphisms within two key genes, CRHR1 and FKBP5. Data suggest that these genes regulate HPA axis function in conjunction with exposure to child maltreatment or abuse. In addition, a large and growing body of preclinical research suggests that increased activity of the amygdala-HPA axis induced by experimental manipulation of the amygdala mimics several of the physiological and behavioral symptoms of stress-related psychiatric illness in humans. Notably, interactions between the developing amygdala and HPA axis underlie critical periods for emotional learning, which are modulated by developmental support and maternal care. These translational findings lead to an integrated hypothesis: high levels of early life trauma lead to disease through the developmental interaction of genetic variants with neural circuits that regulate emotion, together mediating risk and resilience in adults.},

	abstract = {The past decade has witnessed an exponential growth in studies that have attempted to identify the genetic polymporphisms that moderate the influence of environmental risks on mental disorders. What tends to be neglected in these Gene √ó Environment (G √ó E) interaction studies has been a focus on resilience, which refers to a dynamic pattern of positive adaptation despite the experience of a significant trauma or adversity. In this article, we argue that one step toward advancing the field of developmental psychopathology would be for G √ó E research to consider resilience instead of focusing almost exclusively on mental disorders. After providing an up-to-date summary on the expanding definitions and models of resilience, and the available evidence regarding measured G √ó E studies of childhood maltreatment, we discuss why resilience would be a worthwhile phenotype for studies of measured G √ó E. First, although G √ó E hypotheses require that there be an environmental risk (e-risk) involved in a causal process that leads to psychopathology, e-risks are typically not included in the diagnostic criteria for most psychiatric disorders. In contrast, resilience by definition includes an e-risk. Second, G √ó E hypotheses require that there is evidence of variability in response to an environmental stressor, and resilience often represents the positive end on this continuum of adaptation. Third, both resilience and G √ó E are best understood from a developmental perspective. Fourth, although resilient outcomes are not public health concerns, the types of adversities (e.g., childhood maltreatment, poverty, or exposure to natural disasters) that are often investigated in studies of resilience certainly are. Understanding how some individuals, perhaps because of their genetic makeup, are able to withstand such adversities can inform prevention and intervention efforts to improve mental health.},

	abstract = {Objective Optimism and resilience promote health and well-being in older adults, and previous reports suggest that these traits are heritable. We examined the association of selected single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with optimism and resilience in older adults. Design Candidate gene association study that was a follow-on at the University of California, San Diego, sites of two NIH-funded multi-site longitudinal investigations: Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and SELenium and vitamin E Cancer prevention Trial (SELECT). Participants 426 women from WHI older than age 50 years, and 509 men older than age 55 years (age 50 years for African American men) from SELECT. Measurements 65 candidate gene SNPs that were judged by consensus, based on a literature review, as being related to predisposition to optimism and resilience, and 31 ancestry informative marker SNPs, genotyped from blood-based DNA samples and self-report scales for trait optimism, resilience, and depressive symptoms. Results Using a Bonferroni threshold for significant association (p = 0.00089), there were no significant associations for individual SNPs with optimism or resilience in single-locus analyses. Exploratory multi-locus polygenic analyses with p {\textless}0.05 showed an association of optimism with SNPs in MAOA, IL10, and FGG genes, and an association of resilience with a SNP in MAOA gene. Conclusions Correcting for Type I errors, there were no significant associations of optimism and resilience with specific gene SNPs in single-locus analyses. Positive psychological traits are likely to be genetically complex, with many loci having small effects contributing to phenotypic variation. Our exploratory multi-locus polygenic analyses suggest that larger sample sizes and complementary approaches involving methods such as sequence-based association studies, copy number variation analyses, and pathway-based analyses could be useful for better understanding the genetic basis of these positive psychological traits.},

Structural equation model fitting was employed to determine sources of variation of PA, reward experience, and the association between reward experience and stress-sensitivity.

These multidisciplinary experts provide insight into these difficult questions, and although each of the panelists had a slightly different definition of resilience, most of the proposed definitions included a concept of healthy, adaptive, or integrated positive functioning over the passage of time in the aftermath of adversity. The panelists agreed that resilience is a complex construct and it may be defined differently in the context of individuals, families, organizations, societies, and cultures. With regard to the determinants of resilience, there was a consensus that the empirical study of this construct needs to be approached from a multiple level of analysis perspective that includes genetic, epigenetic, developmental, demographic, cultural, economic, and social variables. The empirical study of determinates of resilience will inform efforts made at fostering resilience, with the recognition that resilience may be enhanced on numerous levels (e.g., individual, family, community, culture).},

Resilience is noted to cover a vriety of domains, from the specific circumstances, to the individual, their family, to society.
Resilience approaches also allow us to move away from a deficit focused model of mental health and allow for the includion of building strengths in addition to addressing psychopathology.
Despite a sense that resilience can be different for all individuals across different situations, Bonanno offers the suggestion that we focus on empirical data to address what we mean by resilience, in order to measure it reliably and Southwick also mentions that it is important to specify whether resilience is viewed as a trait, process, or outcome in determining the same definitions, operalationalisations and research questions.

While Masten approaches resilience from a systems perspective, looking for broad definitions that apply across different disciplines and levels of analysis - allowing for a definition such as the capacity of a dynamic system to adapt successfully to disturbances that threated the viability, the function, or the development of that system (Masten, 2014a, 2014b). 

Panter-Brick offers three "deadly sins of resilience research". 1)to be conceptually hazy, 2) to be empirically light, and 3) to be methodologically lame with respect to how we measure resilience.

Each panelist takes a different disciplinary approach to resilience, while appreachiating the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in order to examine the wide range of facets that resilience has.

In this article, resilience is discussed as covering many levels of analysis, including; genetic, epigenetic, developmental, demographic, clutural, economic, and social. Numerous factors to develop resilience were also discussed. Cognitive aspects of resilience are not broached at all in this article.

Focusing on resilience rather than pathophysiology in many ways represents a paradigm shift in clinical-psychological and psychiatric research that has great potential for the development of new prevention and treatment strategies. More recently, research into resilience also arrived in the neurobiological community, posing non-trivial questions about ecological validity and translatability. Drawing on concepts and findings from transdiagnostic psychiatry, emotion research and behavioral and cognitive neuroscience, we propose a unified theoretical framework for the neuroscientific study of general resilience mechanisms. The framework is applicable to both animal and human research and supports the design and interpretation of translational studies. The theory emphasizes the causal role of stimulus appraisal (evaluation) processes in the generation of emotional responses, including responses to potential stressors. On this basis, it posits that a positive (non-negative) appraisal style is the key mechanism that protects against the detrimental effects of stress and mediates the effects of other known resilience factors. Appraisal style is shaped by three classes of cognitive processes (positive situation classification, reappraisal, and interference inhibition) that can be investigated at the neural level. Prospects for the future development of resilience research are discussed.},

	abstract = {The broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions suggests that positive emotions can widen the range of potential coping strategies that come to mind and subsequently enhance one's resilience against stress. Studies have shown that high stress, especially chronic levels of stress, strongly contributes to the development of anxiety and depressive symptoms. However, researchers have also found that individuals who possess high levels of resilience are protected from stress and thus report lower levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Using a sample of 200 postdoctoral research fellows, the present study examined if (a) positive emotions were associated with greater resilience, (b) coping strategies mediated the link between positive emotions and resilience and (c) resilience moderated the influence of stress on trait anxiety and depressive symptoms. Results support the broaden-and-build theory in that positive emotions may enhance resilience directly as well as indirectly through the mediating role of coping strategies-particularly via adaptive coping. Resilience also moderated the association of stress with trait anxiety and depressive symptoms. Although stress is unavoidable and its influences on anxiety and depressive symptoms are undeniable, the likelihood of postdocs developing anxiety or depressive symptoms may be reduced by implementing programmes designed to increase positive emotions, adaptive coping strategies and resilience.

	abstract = {The genetic basis of resilience, defined as better cognitive functioning than predicted based on neuroimaging or neuropathology, is not well understood. Our objective was to identify genetic variation associated with executive functioning resilience. We computed residuals from regression models of executive functioning, adjusting for age, sex, education, Hachinski score, and MRI findings (lacunes, cortical thickness, volumes of white matter hyperintensities and hippocampus). We estimated heritability and analyzed these residuals in models for each SNP. We further evaluated our most promising SNP result by evaluating cis-associations with brain levels of nearby (¬±100 kb) genes from a companion data set, and comparing expression levels in cortex and cerebellum from decedents with AD with those from other non-AD diseases. Complete data were available for 750 ADNI participants of European descent. Executive functioning resilience was highly heritable (H¬≤‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.76; S.E. = 0.44). rs3748348 on chromosome 14 in the region of RNASE13 was associated with executive functioning resilience (p-value‚Äâ=‚Äâ4.31‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10‚Åª‚Å∑). rs3748348 is in strong linkage disequilibrium (D' of 1.00 and 0.96) with SNPs that map to TPPP2, a member of the Œ±-synuclein family of proteins. We identified nominally significant associations between rs3748348 and expression levels of three genes (FLJ10357, RNASE2, and NDRG2). The strongest association was for FLJ10357 in cortex, which also had the most significant difference in expression between AD and non-AD brains, with greater expression in cortex of decedents with AD (p-value‚Äâ=‚Äâ7‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10‚Åª‚Å∑).

In the emotion-relevant task, there were no main effects or interations including trait anxiety.

In the emotion-irrelevant task, there was an interaction between target emotion and trait anxiety (p=.03), high levels of trait anxiety were associated with greater attention bias to angry over happy faces. This effect appears to be driven by a slowing of responses to happy faces rather than a speeding of response to angry faces.

Both anxious and non-anxious individuals showed attentional bias towards emotional faces when the stimuli was task relevant, however, the difference emerged when the emotion was made task irrelevant. the enhanced attention to angry faces relative to angry faces seemed to be driven by differences in responding to happy faces.

This may be an interesting point to bring up with respect to my results, in that my attention bias task results indicated that the differences were driven by differential processing of positive stimuli, with respect tp the stimuli that they were paired with. 

The results potentially indicate that anxious indiiduals maintain or have a chronically activated threat- or emotion- related goals which lead to these attention biases, relative to controls. and importantly, the distinction is made therefore between task-relevant and goal-relevant information processing baises, and task-irrelevant biases. This is a very important point to make I think. Although the results could also suggest a persistant attentional bias, as most other theories posit - but the task/goal relatedness is an interesting and important angle.

I love the fnal comment with the (maladaptive) attention to threat, as it highlights once again that attentional biases can be either adaptive or maladaptive depending on the task/goal/situational demands. Awesome point, and makes me glad for the collaboration especially.

Studies of facial emotion processing and facial{\textbackslash}nemotion recognition were identified up to December 2009 utilizing{\textbackslash}nMEDLINE and Web of Science.{\textbackslash}nAlthough methodological variations complicate interpretation of{\textbackslash}nfindings, there is reasonably consistent evidence of a negative response{\textbackslash}nbias towards sadness in individuals with major depression, so that{\textbackslash}npositive (happy), neutral or ambiguous facial expressions tend to be{\textbackslash}nevaluated as more sad or less happy compared with healthy control{\textbackslash}ngroups. There is also evidence of increased vigilance and selective{\textbackslash}nattention towards sad expressions and away from happy expressions, but{\textbackslash}nless evidence of reduced general or emotion-specific recognition{\textbackslash}naccuracy.

Participants provided valid data after receiving a computerised face emotion recognition task following standardised assessment of diagnosis and mood symptoms.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: In the control group women were more accurate in recognising emotions than men owing to greater discrimination. Among participants with depression, those in remission correctly identified more emotions than controls owing to increased response bias, whereas those currently depressed recognised fewer emotions owing to decreased discrimination. These effects were most marked for anger, fear and sadness but there was no significant emotion √ó group interaction, and a similar pattern tended to be seen for happiness although not for surprise or disgust. These differences were confined to participants who were antidepressant-free, with those taking antidepressants having similar results to the control group.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities in face emotion recognition differ between people with current depression and those in remission. Reduced discrimination in depressed participants may reflect withdrawal from the emotions of others, whereas the increased bias in those with a history of depression could contribute to vulnerability to relapse. The normal face emotion recognition seen in those taking medication may relate to the known effects of antidepressants on emotional processing and could contribute to their ability to protect against depressive relapse.},

	abstract = {Pavlovian threat (fear) conditioning (PTC) is an experimental paradigm that couples innate aversive stimuli with neutral cues to elicit learned defensive behavior in response to the neutral cue. PTC is commonly used as a translational model to study neurobiological and behavioral aspects of fear and anxiety disorders including Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Though PTSD is a complex multi-faceted construct that cannot be fully captured in animals PTC is a conceptually valid model for studying the development and maintenance of learned threat responses. Thus, it can inform the understanding of PTSD symptomatology. However, there are significant individual differences in posttraumatic stress that are not as of yet accounted for in studies of PTC. Individuals exposed to danger have been shown to follow distinct patterns: some adapt rapidly and completely (resilience) others adapt slowly (recovery) and others failure to adapt (chronic stress response). Identifying similar behavioral outcomes in PTC increases the translatability of this model. In this report we present a flexible methodology for identifying individual differences in PTC by modeling latent subpopulations or classes characterized by defensive behavior during training. We provide evidence from a reanalysis of previously examined PTC learning and extinction data in rats to demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodology in identifying outcomes analogous to those observed in humans exposed to threat. By utilizing Latent Class Growth Analysis (LCGA) to test for heterogeneity in freezing behavior during threat conditioning and extinction learning in adult male outbred rats (n = 58) three outcomes were identified: rapid extinction (57.3\%), slow extinction (32.3\%), and failure to extinguish (10.3\%) indicating that heterogeneity analogous to that in naturalistic human studies is present in experimental animal studies strengthening their translatability in understanding stress responses in humans.},

	abstract = {Psychological resilience has become a popular concept. Owing to that popularity, the word resilience has taken on myriad and often overlapping meanings. To be a useful framework for psychological research and theory, the authors argue, the study of resilience must explicitly reference each of four constituent temporal elements: (a) baseline or preadversity functioning, (b) the actual aversive circumstances, (c) postadversity resilient outcomes, and (d) predictors of resilient outcomes. Using this framework to review the existing literature, the most complete body of evidence is available on individual psychological resilience in children and adults. By contrast, the research on psychological resilience in families and communities is far more limited and lags well behind the rich theoretical perspective available from those literatures. The vast majority of research on resilience in families and communities has focused primarily on only one temporal element, possible predictors of resilient outcomes. Surprisingly, however, almost no scientific evidence is actually available for community or family resilient outcomes. We close by suggesting that there is room for optimism and that existing methods and measures could be relatively easily adapted to help fill these gaps. To that end, we propose a series of steps to guide future research},

	abstract = {Background and objectives Prolonged Grief (PG) is recognized as a post-bereavement syndrome that is associated with significant impairment. Although approach and avoidance tendencies have both been hypothesized to play key roles in maintaining PG symptoms, understanding of these relationships has been limited by a reliance on self-report methodology. This study applies an experimental paradigm to simultaneously investigate the relationship between PG severity and approach-avoidance behavioral tendencies. Methods Fifty-five bereaved individuals with and without PG completed a behavioral measure of approach and avoidance responding in which they pulled or pushed a joystick in response to grief-related, positive, negative and neutral images that appeared on a computer screen. Concurrent visual feedback created the illusion that the images were either approaching or receding from the participant. Half of the participants also received a prime designed to activate their grief prior to the task. Results Irrespective of prime condition, PG participants pulled grief-related images more quickly than they pushed them. This difference was not observed in response to non-grief related images. Non PG participants showed no difference in their reaction times to grief-stimuli. Limitations This study was undertaken in a nonclinical setting and the majority of participants had lost a loved one due to chronic illness. Future research with treatment-seeking populations and sudden loss will be needed to explore the generalizability of the findings. Conclusions The findings from this study provide preliminary evidence supporting models of PG that integrate approach and avoidance tendencies.},

The extent to which findings are relevant to other bereavements is uncertain. A major methodological limitation of current studies has been a reliance on retrospective reporting of functioning and use of samples of individuals who have self-selected for participant in grief research. To address these limitations, in the current study we applied Latent Growth Mixture Modelling (LGMM) in a prospective population-based sample to identify trajectories of depression following spousal and child bereavement in later life. The sample consisted of 2512 individual bereaved adults who were assessed once before and three times after their loss. Four discrete trajectories were identified: Resilience (little or no depression; 68.2\%), Chronic Grief (an onset of depression following loss; 13.2\%), Depressed-Improved (high pre-loss depression that decreased following loss; 11.2\%), and Pre-existing Chronic Depression (high depression at all assessments; 7.4\%). These trajectories were present for both child and spousal loss. There was some evidence that child loss in later life was associated more strongly with the Chronic Grief trajectory and less strongly with the Resilience trajectory. However these differences disappeared when covariates were included in the model. Limitations of the analyses are discussed. These findings increase our understanding of the variety of outcomes following bereavement and underscore the importance of using prospective designs to map heterogeneity of response outcomes.},

We integrate these individual differences in a hypothesized model of resilience, focusing on their role in appraisal processes and the use of social resources.

This investigation addressed this deficit in a sample of middle-aged bereaved adults (N œ≠ 48) whose emotion responses were measured as they described loss and non-loss-related events during a laboratory interview 4 months after the death of their spouse or child. Symptoms of depression were assessed using structured clinical interviews at 4 and 18 months postloss. Although positive emotions were beneficial regardless of context, context sensitivity for negative emotions at 4 months predicted fewer depression symptoms at 18 months. These findings suggest that the capacity to shift negative emotion responses according to changing context may differentiate those individuals who will show improvements in depression symptoms over time from those who will show chronic impairments.

In the past several decades, however, resilience has gained currency as a psychological construct, first in the developmental literature on chronic adversity and more recently in the literature on loss, trauma and other forms of acute adversity in adults. As the construct migrated, from the study of adversity in children to the study of acute events in adults, it was reasonable to anticipate that corresponding changes in the construct√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s operational definition would be required. Unfortunately, much of the research on resilience in adults has been carried out without consideration of these modifications. As a result, misuses and misunderstandings have proliferated. In the hopes of bringing some clarity to the study of resilient outcomes in adults, I first review three approaches that have suffered from serious conceptual misunderstandings: resilience as a personality characteristic; resilience as the absence of psychopathology; and resilience as a general term to connote average levels of psychological adjustment. Next, I review research that avoids these pitfalls by defining resilience as a stable trajectory of healthy functioning in response to a clearly defined event. I conclude the article by describing a set of methodological criteria to guide future studies of resilience and its predictors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

The impairment of executive functions in various clinical groups is a topic of much debate, as are recent attempts to formulate the corresponding intervention and rehabilitation regimes of these dysfunctions. This article reviewed current theories of executive functions and their associated assessment instruments. In addition, it identified issues that are imperative for more accurate, sensitive, and specific assessment of various components of this construct. It is concluded that more research is needed to fractionate the executive system by assessing a wide range of functions and to verify their neuroanatomical correlates. Recently developed measurement models and technology may also facilitate a more ecologically and ethologically valid assessment for the specific needs of different individuals. ?? 2007 National Academy of Neuropsychology.},

	abstract = {Cognitive models of anxiety propose that selective attention to negative information plays a causal role in heightened anxiety vulnerability and dysfunction. However, there has been theoretical disagreement concerning whether anxiety-linked attentional biases reflect enhanced attentional engagement with, or impaired attentional disengagement from, negative information. We contend that previous methodologies have not been optimal in terms of their capacity to differentiate both types of bias. The present study introduces a refined methodology, in which the conventional dot-probe task is modified in a novel manner to enable the independent assessment of these components of attention. The findings demonstrate that facilitated attentional engagement and impaired attentional disengagement are both characteristic of elevated levels of anxiety vulnerability. Moreover, these prove to be unrelated facets of attentional selectivity that independently contribute to variation in anxiety vulnerability. We discuss the possibility that these two types of attentional bias may represent independent pathways to anxiety vulnerability.},

	volume = {142},
	abstract = {Cognitive deficits are now widely recognized to be an important component of anxiety. In particular, anxiety is thought to restrict the capacity of working memory by competing with task-relevant processes. The evidence for this claim, however, has been mixed. Although some studies have found restricted working memory in anxiety, others have not. Within studies that have found impairments, there is little agreement regarding the boundary conditions of the anxiety/WMC association. The aim of this review is to critically evaluate the evidence for anxiety-related deficits in working memory capacity. First, a meta-analysis of 177 samples (N = 22,061 individuals) demonstrated that self-reported measures of anxiety are reliably related to poorer performance on measures of working memory capacity (g = ‚àí.334, p {\textless} 10‚àí29). This finding was consistent across complex span (e.g., OSPAN; g = ‚àí.342, k = 30, N = 3,196, p = .000001), simple span (e.g., digit span; g = ‚àí.318, k = 127, N = 17,547, p {\textless} 10‚àí17), and dynamic span tasks (e.g., N-Back; g = ‚àí.437, k = 20, N = 1,318, p = .000003). Second, a narrative review of the literature revealed that anxiety, whether self-reported or experimentally induced, is related to poorer performance across a wide variety of tasks. Finally, the review identified a number of methodological limitations common in the literature as well as avenues for future research.},

But, there are still many unresolved conceptual and research issues, as more variables are being proposed as relevant. As part of this process, the present paper proposes hardiness as an addition to positive psychology. Hardiness is a combination of attitudes that provides the courage and motivation to do the hard, strategic work of turning stressful circumstances from potential disasters into growth opportunities. In this regard, the inherently stressful nature of living is discussed. Also clarified are the particular aspects of excellence in performance and health to which hardiness is relevant. The paper concludes with a call for issue-resolving research through which orientations and actions proposed as part of positive psychology can be compared in their contributions to performance and health. Two studies along these lines have found hardiness more powerful than optimism and religiousness in coping with stresses.

As such, it differs from both social competence positive mental health. Resilience differs from traditional concepts of risk and protection in its focus on individual variations in response to comparable experiences. Accordingly, the research focus needs to be on those individual differences and the causal processes that they reflect, rather than on resilience as a general quality. Because resilience in relation to childhood adversities may stem from positive adult experiences, a life-span trajectory approach is needed. Also, because of the crucial importance of gene-environment interactions in relation to resilience, a wide range of research strategies spanning psychosocial and biological methods is needed. Five main implications stem from the research to date: (1) resistance to hazards may derive from controlled exposure to risk (rather than its avoidance); (2) resistance may derive from traits or circumstances that are without major effects in the absence of the relevant environmental hazards; (3) resistance may derive from physiological or psychological coping processes rather than external risk or protective factors; (4) delayed recovery may derive from "turning point" experiences in adult life; and (5) resilience may be constrained by biological programming or damaging effects of stress/adversity on neural structures.},

The research framework defined the meaning, models, and methods that successfully guided four waves of research to date on the nature and processes involved in human resilience. The applied framework emerged in response to urgent needs of children and families faced by adversity and those charged with helping them, resulting in guidelines for translating the unfolding but incomplete research evidence into action. The application of a resilience approach transformed practice in many fields concerned with promoting resilience in people at risk for problems, revolutionizing the mission, models, measures, and methods of practice to align with the emphasis on positive adaptation and strengths defining a resilience-based approach. Yet these interventions rarely translated back to inform and refine resilience theory in ways that would accelerate progress to promote resilience more effectively. The concluding section on translational synergy discusses the potential for a synthesis of basic and applied resilience frameworks as the next steps toward realizing the original objective and promise of resilience science.},

Initiated by Norman Garmezy, the PCLS contributed models, measures, and methods, as well as working definitions of concepts like competence, developmental tasks, protective factors, and resilience. Findings from the study corroborated the feasibility of studying adaptation in a normative group of school children, identifying patterns of resilience, competence without major adversity, and maladaptive paths through life. Competence was multidimensional, showing continuity and change over time. Cascading effects across domains indicated that competence and problems spread over time. Thus, adult achievements in developmental tasks were rooted in childhood and adolescence. Young people who showed resilience had much in common with similarly successful peers who experienced less adversity over time, including high-quality relationships with parents and other adults, and good cognitive, as well as social-emotional, skills. Maladaptive youth in the study often faced high adversity with little adaptive capacity (internal or external) and tended to generate stressful experiences. Resilience often emerged in childhood and endured, but there also were late bloomers whose lives turned around in the transition to adulthood. The role of collaboration and mentorship in the PCLS is also discussed.},

Considering the functional links between perception, attention, and action regulation, we posit that when people can avoid the aversive consequences, sensitivity of the perceptual system to danger signals should be enhanced, whereas it should be reduced when there is no such option. To test this prediction, we used a search task in which tachistoscopically presented conjunctions of features had to be detected. Parameters of sensitivity and response bias were analyzed drawing on procedures from signal detection theory. Although the experimental procedure rewarded correct responses, the predicted asymmetry emerged. For stimuli that were linked to a negative consequence (loss of points in the experimental game), perceptual sensitivity was enhanced when participants had the opportunity to neutralize the loss in a second task; an opposite pattern emerged when they had no such opportunity.},

Animal models and human neuroimaging experiments provide complementary insights, yet efforts to integrate the two are often complicated by limitations inherent in drawing comparisons between unrelated studies with disparate designs. Translating from a rodent model of chronic stress where we have shown reversible disruption of PFC function, we show that psychosocial stress induces long-lasting but reversible impairments in behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures of PFC function in humans. Twenty healthy adults, exposed to 1 month of psychosocial stress, confirmed by a validated rating scale, were scanned while performing a PFC-dependent attention-shifting task. One month later, they returned for a second scanning session after a period of reduced stress, and their performance was compared with a twice-scanned, matched group of low-stress controls. Psychosocial stress selectively impaired attentional control and disrupted functional connectivity within a frontoparietal network that mediates attention shifts. These effects were reversible: after one month of reduced stress, the same subjects showed no significant differences from controls. These results highlight the plasticity of PFC networks in healthy human subjects and suggest one mechanism by which disrupted plasticity may contribute to cognitive impairments characteristic of stress-related neuropsychiatric conditions in susceptible individuals.},

In addition to decreasing attentional control, anxiety increases attention to threat-related stimuli. Adverse effects of anxiety on processing efficiency depend on two central executive functions involving attentional control: inhibition and shifting. However, anxiety may not impair performance effectiveness (quality of performance) when it leads to the use of compensatory strategies (e.g., enhanced effort; increased use of processing resources).

(see record 2004-10043-003). The author of this comment notes that Bonanno's article is a compelling analysis of several different reactions to extremely aversive events. With regard to major stressors, such as the death of a loved one or the experience a life-threatening circumstance, there is, notably, not only the psychopathological breakdown (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD] or depressive disorder) that has been emphasized but also the less recognized resilient response, in which there is little or no loss of functioning. Whereas the emphasis in the breakdown response is understandably on treatment that facilitates recovery, the resilient response may require little but the person's own ongoing efforts in life to continue effectively. Indeed, Bonanno suggested that the typical treatment efforts following traumatic events might actually undermine the resilient person's adjustment efforts. Bonanno's conceptualization and supportive research evidence advance our understanding of individuals' reactions to massive stressors. Further, Bonanno (2004) argued that there are multiple pathways to resilience under stress, and he identified personality hardiness as one of them. His presentation of hardiness accurately emphasizes its interrelated attitudes of commitment (rather than alienation), control (rather than powerlessness), and challenge (rather than threat) but does not cover how this concept has evolved over the last 25 years. Coordinating theory, research, and practice over this period of time, the author has concluded (Maddi, 2002) that hardy attitudes amount to the courage and motivation to face stressors accurately (rather than to deny or catastrophize them). This courage and motivation lead to coping by problem solving rather than by avoiding and to interacting with others by giving and getting assistance and encouragement rather than by striking out or overprotecting. Thus, personality hardiness is emerging as a pattern of attitudes and actions that helps in transforming stressors from potential disasters into growth opportunities. The author concludes that Bonanno's exciting position has opened the way for such comparative analytic research through which researchers can further their current knowledge concerning how resilience under stress comes about.

Hardiness is a combination of attitudes that provides the courage and motivation to do the hard, strategic work of turning stressful circumstances from potential disasters into growth opportunities. In this regard, the inherently stressful nature of living is discussed. Also clarified are the particular aspects of excellence in performance and health to which hardiness is relevant. The paper concludes with a call for issue-resolving research through which orientations and actions proposed as part of positive psychology can be compared in their contributions to performance and health.

	issn = {0269-9931},
	doi = {10.1080/02699938808410927},
	abstract = {The account of cognitive vulnerability to depression offered by Beck's cognitive model is summarised. As this account currently lacks consistent empirical support, an alternative, related, account is presented. This proposes that, once a person is initially depressed, an important factor that determines whether their depression remains mild or transient, or becomes more severe and persistent, is the nature of the negative cognitive processes and constructs that become active and accessible in the depressed state. These interact with the nature of environmental difficulties, available social support, and biological factors, to determine whether a depression-maintaining cognitive-affective vicious cycle will be set up. Results from studies specifically designed to test predictions from this account have yielded positive results. Findings consistent with the hypothesis have also been obtained in other prospective studies which have shown that cognitive measures, administered in the depressed state, predict the future course of depression independently of initial levels of depression. The hypothesis is elaborated to incorporate the demonstrated relationship of elevated neuroticism to risk and persistence of depression. Recent views on the nature of sex differences in rates of depression, and on the relationship of attributional style to depression are also compatible with the hypothesis. It is concluded that the hypothesis has encouraging preliminary support. SUMMARY Two broad aspects of cognitive vulnerability to depression can be distinguished. The first is the tendency to evaluate certain types of life event in ways which will produce intense rather than mild depression. This is the aspect of vulnerability on which Beck's cognitive model appears to concentrate. There are considerable difficulties in assessing this aspect of Beck's model and it is not consistently supported by comparison of recovered depressed patients with control groups. The second aspect of cognitive vulnerability relates to the cognitive processes and constructs that become active and accessible once a person is in a state of depression. Within this approach, vulnerability to onset and vulnerability to persistence of depression can be roughly distinguished, depending on whether the focus is on the period when the depression has been present for only a brief period, or is mild, or whether depression has already existed for some time and reached at least moderate severity. The account presented here proposes that a crucial factor determining whether an initially mild or transient depressed state remains mild or soon disappears, or becomes more severe and persistent, is whether a vicious cycle based on a reciprocally reinforcing relationship between depressed mood and negative cognitive processing can become established. The probability that this cycle will become established is, in turn, a function of a complex interaction between the environmental difficulties facing a person, the support available to them, their biological state, and the nature of the cognitive processes and constructs that are active and accessible in the depressed state. The kind of cognitive process and constructs that are most active and accessible in the depressed state will be a function both of the patterns of cognitive processing that are characteristic of the person in their normal mood state (such as those related to neuroticism), and of the patterns of cognitive processing that become active in the depressed state. It is on these latter that the differential activation hypothesis concentrates. It suggests that individual differences in the cognitive processes and constructs that become active and accessible in the depressed' state can make an important contribution to whether an initial state of depression becomes more intense, or fades away, and whether, once established, depression of moderate severity persists a long time or a short time. In particular, it is proposed that processes and constructs related to global negative characterological evaluations of the self or that, in other ways, lead to interpretations of experience as highly aversive and uncontrollable are likely to act to intensify and maintain depression. Two investigations specifically designed to test predictions from the differential activation hypothesis yielded positive results. Further supportive evidence is available from a number of other studies which have examined the relationship between cognitive measures, administered in the depressed state, and the future course of depression. Such studies haverecurringly found that persistence or return of depression is associated with initially high scores on measures of negative cognition, and this association remains when the effects of initial depression level are partialled out. In addition to this encouraging preliminary empirical support, the differential activation hypothesis has the further attraction that it can incorporate into this account the well established finding that neuroticism is associated with risk of becoming depressed, and of depression persisting. Further, it is quite consistent with recent proposals related to sex differences in rates of depression, and to the relationship of attributional style to depression.},

	abstract = {Dual process models offer powerful accounts of cognitive phenomena in social and personality psychology but they have not been widely adapted to clinical phenomena. This review presents a dual process model of cognitive vulnerability to unipolar depression. According to dual process theories, humans possess two modes of information processing. An associative mode involves quick, effortless processing that rests on well-learned associations. A reflective mode involves slow, effortful processing that rests on symbolic rule-based inferences. Whereas the associative mode occurs automatically, the reflective mode operates when expectancies are violated and sufficient cognitive resources are available to respond. A cognitive vulnerability to depression is observed when negatively biased associative processing is uncorrected by reflective processing. The circumstances when this is likely to occur are reviewed. New insights and implications for assessment, etiology, and treatment of cognitive vulnerability to depression are discussed. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Attentional bias modification (ABM) represents one of a number of cognitive bias modification techniques which are beginning to show promise as therapeutic interventions for emotional pathology. Numerous studies with both clinical and non-clinical populations have now demonstrated that ABM can reduce emotional vulnerability. However, some recent studies have failed to achieve change in either selective attention or emotional vulnerability using ABM methodologies, including a recent randomised controlled trial by Carlbring et al. Some have sought to represent such absence of evidence as a sound basis not to further pursue ABM as an online intervention. While these findings obviously raise questions about the specific conditions under which ABM procedures will produce therapeutic benefits, we suggest that the failure of some studies to modify selective attention does not challenge the theoretical and empirical basis of ABM. The present paper seeks to put these ABM failures in perspective within the broader context of attentional bias modification research. In doing so it is apparent that the current findings and future prospects of ABM are in fact very promising, suggesting that more research in this area is warranted, not less.},

The present study used a dual target rapid visual presentation paradigm to examine the temporal allocation of attention to facial expressions of anger and happiness in 16 Palestinian victims of torture with PTSD and 16 control subjects. Findings revealed that signals of threat seem to interfere with already processed information in individuals suffering from PTSD. In contrast, PTSD does not facilitate attention to threatening information. The data provide support for detrimental disengagement as an underlying mechanism of the attentional bias toward threat in PTSD, possibly contributing to symptom development and maintenance. ¬© 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

	abstract = {A large number of gene-environment interaction studies provide evidence that some people are more likely to be negatively affected by adverse experiences as a function of specific genetic variants. However, such "risk" variants are surprisingly frequent in the population. Evolutionary analysis suggests that genetic variants associated with increased risk for maladaptive development under adverse environmental conditions are maintained in the population because they are also associated with advantages in response to different contextual conditions. These advantages may include (a) coexisting genetic resilience pertaining to other adverse influences, (b) a general genetic susceptibility to both low and high environmental quality, and (c) a coexisting propensity to benefit disproportionately from positive and supportive exposures, as reflected in the recent framework of vantage sensitivity. After introducing the basic properties of vantage sensitivity and highlighting conceptual similarities and differences with diathesis-stress and differential susceptibility patterns of gene-environment interaction, selected and recent empirical evidence for the notion of vantage sensitivity as a function of genetic differences is reviewed. The unique contribution that the new perspective of vantage sensitivity may make to our understanding of social inequality will be discussed after suggesting neurocognitive and molecular mechanisms hypothesized to underlie the propensity to benefit disproportionately from benevolent experiences.},

Using electrical neuroimaging and psychophysiology in a cross-over design, we tested the hypothesis that different types of anticipatory anxiety (bodily vs. psychological), transiently induced in healthy participants, had dissociable effects on brain systems regulating attention control. Attention control corresponded to the ability to maintain efficient goal-directed processing (indexed by the P300 ERP component and by activations in the attentional networks), as well as the ability to filter out irrelevant stimuli in early sensory cortex (C1 component, indexing attentional gating in V1). Results showed that while psychosocial threat, very much like perceptual load, primarily led to a stronger gating in V1, bodily threat resulted in impaired goal-directed processing within the fronto-parietal attentional network, as well as decreased filtering in V1. These results suggest that anticipatory anxiety is multifaceted, exerting different effects on attention control and early visual processing depending on its sub-type. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

One hundred fifty-seven undergraduate participants completed daily diaries for six consecutive days. Affective flexibility was measured with a novel task-switching paradigm using emotional pictures. Results show that affective inflexibility when switching away from processing the emotional meaning of negative material was associated with increased use of rumination in daily life. In contrast, affective inflexibility when switching away from processing the emotional meaning of positive material was related to decreased use of rumination. Importantly, affective flexibility predicted use of rumination beyond non-affective measures of executive functioning.

this is potentially an important point/paper, as it argues that the same strategy may be used appropriately or innapropriately, but depending on individual's flexibility(note on p. 2)},
	annote = {Rumination has been found to be related to the ability to remove irrelevant negative information from working memory (e.g. joormann and gotlib, 2008). Further, De Lissnyder et al. 2010 found that ruminators showed inhibition impairments specific to the processing of negative emotional information. 

The authirs hypothesised that affective flexibility would predict rumination use in response to daily negative events above and beyond that of non-affective measures of xecutive control. 
In addition they predicted that affetive inflexibility in switching from positive material would be related to decreased use of rumination. 

They used a novel affective-switching task, similar to Garnet \& Siemer's (2011). 
The task used IAPS pictures split into positive and negative, and with 2+ people or less than 2 people. Pictures were presented and participants asked to sort the pictures based on an affective (classify as positive or negative), or non-affective (the number of people). lower switch costs ( switch - repetition RTs) indicate greater affective flexibility. 

The cognitive flexibility task was similar except with the categories of odd-even and higher/lower than 5.
Working memory capacity was assessed with the automated reading span test. 

Daily diary measures were taken for6 days. Participants reported on the most negative event of the day, and rate how unpleasant it was. They then answered six modified rumination items from the Ruminative response scale targeted at that specific event, rather than ruminative tendencies in general. 
Participants also reported daily mood with high and low arousal negative items. Depressive symptoms were also reported.

random coefficient modelling approach was used for nalysis, with daily observations of rumination (level 1) nested within people (level 2).

In the diary data, only unpleasant events rated hihgly were included in the analysis.

In the overall model, only the switch costs that resulted from switching away from focus on the positive and negative pictures predicted levels of daily rumination. 

the data supported the hypotheses. rumination was positively associated with higher switching costs in negative images, and higher costs when switching from positive associated with lower rumination. 

In essence, cognitive inflexibility for positive emotional content was associated with reduced rumination. 
But these analyses were only signitficant for the switch costs when the rule was non-affective. 
[important point for my own stuff, e.g. the IST, is that the key thing there was during the emotional task, but ]


In discussion, the authors note that it was switches away from the emotional material that predicted rumination. Also a really important point that they made is that the same process and task, but under different emotional conditions hihglighted adaptive and maladaptive uses of that process.},

A new affective task-switching paradigm that required participants to shift between categorizing positive and negative affective pictures according to emotional or nonemotional features was used to assess individual differences in affective flexibility. The results showed that greater affective flexibility (less switch costs) predicted the ability to use reappraisal to down-regulate emotions in response to a sad film clip. In particular, more efficient shifts toward the neutral aspects of negative pictures and toward the emotional aspects of positive pictures were found to predict reappraisal ability.

The present study examined cognitive processes that may explain individual differences in trait resilience. Participants completed self-report measures of trait resilience, cognitive flexibility and working memory capacity tasks, and a novel affective task-switching paradigm that assesses the ability to flexibly switch between processing the affective versus non-affective qualities of affective stimuli (i.e., flexible affective processing). As hypothesised, cognitive flexibility and flexible affective processing were unique predictors of trait resilience. Working memory capacity was not predictive of trait resilience, indicating that trait resilience is tied to specific cognitive processes rather than overall better cognitive functioning. Cognitive flexibility and flexible affective processing were not associated with other trait measures, suggesting that these flexibility processes are unique to trait resilience.

this is actually very similar to my arguments(note on p. 3)},
	annote = {Psychological flexibility is a core component of resilience, however has not been examined directly as yet. Cognitive flexibility involves 2 components, inhibition and shifting (Miyake et al 2000). Ochsner \& Gross 2007 suggest that cognitive flexibility is related to emotion regulation. This may be particularly true by the process of cognitive flexibility enabling effective emotion regulation thus promoting trait resilience. 

They used the odd/even or lower/higher than 5 task to assess general cognitive flexibility. In the affective task, they sorted words by whether they were adjectives or nouns, or whether they were positive/negative. Switching was investigated in a similar way to the other Ganet and Siemer paper. WM was assessed with an automated reading span test.

They combined the CDRISC and ER89 scales to create a total score (with the z values).

resilience was predicted in a multiple regression by both affective switching costs measures, and general cognitive flexibility, but not by WMC.

This is one of the first demonstrations of a relationship between cognitive flexibility (task switching) and trait resilience in an adult population. 

They argue that resilience is not generally related to general executive function, but rather that trait resilience is tied to specific processes related to flexibility.},

The results showed that greater affective flexibility (less switch costs) predicted the ability to use reappraisal to down-regulate emotions in response to a sad film clip.

	abstract = {Impairment in mental flexibility may be a key component contributing to cardinal cognitive symptoms among mood disorders patients, particularly thought control disorders. Impaired ability to switch from one thought to another might reflect difficulties in either generating new mental states, inhibiting previous states, or both. However, the neural underpinnings of impaired cognitive flexibility in mood disorders remain largely unresolved. We compared a group of mood disorders patients (n = 29) and a group of matched healthy subjects (n = 32) on a novel task-switching paradigm involving happy and sad faces, that allowed us to separate generation of a new mental set (Switch Cost) and inhibition of the previous set during switching (Inhibition Cost), using fMRI. Behavioral data showed a larger Switch Cost in patients relative to controls, but the average Inhibition Cost did not differ between groups. At the neural level, a main effect of group was found with stronger activation of the subgenual cingulate cortex in patients. The larger Switch Cost in patients was reflected by a stronger recruitment of brain regions involved in attention and executive control, including the left intraparietal sulcus, precuneus, left inferior fontal gyrus, and right anterior cingulate. Critically, activity in the subgenual cingulate cortex was not downregulated by inhibition in patients relative to controls. In conclusion, mood disorder patients have exaggerated Switch Cost relative to controls, and this deficit in cognitive flexibility is associated with increased activation of the fronto-parietal attention networks, combined with impaired modulation of the subgenual cingulate cortex when inhibition of previous mental states is needed.

In the present study we tested the hypotheses that resilient people exhibit emotional flexibility: a) in response to frequently changing emotional stimuli; and b) across multiple modalities of emotional responding. As participants viewed a series of emotional pictures, we assessed their self-reported affect, facial muscle activity, and startle reflexes. Higher trait resilience predicted more divergent affective and facial responses (corrugator and zygomatic) to positive versus negative pictures. Thus, compared with their low resilient counterparts, resilient people appear to be able to more flexibly match their emotional responses to the frequently changing emotional stimuli. Moreover, whereas high trait resilient participants exhibited divergent startle responses to positive versus negative pictures regardless of the valence of the preceding trial, low trait resilient participants did not exhibit divergent startle responses when the preceding picture was negative. High trait resilient individuals, therefore, appear to be better able than are their low-resilient counterparts to either switch or maintain their emotional responses depending on whether the emotional context changes. The present findings broaden our understanding of the mechanisms underlying resilience by demonstrating that resilient people are able to flexibly change their affective and physiological responses to match the demands of frequently changing environmental circumstances.},

the data suggest that trait-=resileicne is associated with increased emotional flexibility, rather than merely a more positive processing style.
There were not many direct associations between resilience and the psychophysiological measures. 

they argue that a strength of the study is the use of the ER89 which has been shown to prospectively predict depression, therefore it may be that emotional flexibility contributes to prospective resilience. 

another sound point is raised that actual prospective research is needed and moreover, that this research will need to use other measures of resilience as well as just questionnaire measures. 

the authors argue that an important element of the study is looking at rapid changes in emotional content, rather than longer timeframes

The results showed that MDD individuals were characterized by a general switching impairment. This switching impairment was neither influenced by the task-relevance of emotional information, nor influenced by the valence of the faces within the emotion condition. The impairment in cognitive control reflected in general switching impairments was related to rumination, a specific cognitive symptom and important risk factor of depression.

Hence, the validity of the hypothesis has remained indeterminate. To overcome the problems associated with attentional assessment procedures used in previous studies, and so shed light on the attentional basis of positive affectivity, we employed an appropriate variant of the attentional probe task. Our findings show that participants high in positive affectivity displayed greater relative attention to positive information compared to neutral information, than was the case for their low positive affectivity counterparts.

why as the control training task?(note on p. 3)
these papers are well relevant to a potential training study in adolescents that may be valuable for the grant application.(note on p. 3)},
	annote = {The abstract suggests that the training of cognitive skills is more effective in late adolescense and adulthood than early adolescence. This somewhat goes against a lay prediction that we might expect greater plasticity in adolescents, compared to adults (although I dont know the details of the tasks just yet).

There is a solid evidence base that protracted development of cognitive skills occurs during adolescence, however it is less well known about when these skills are most effectively learned/trained.

three training tasks were used in this study
1. numerosity discrimination - discriminating between numbers
2. relational reasoning - ability to detect abstract relationships between groups of items.
3. face perception - identifying changes in faces and facial features. this was used as a control task (not sure why on this as yet). This was used as a control because it is expected to rely on different neural circuits and processes, whereas the first two are held to be more directly relevant to education and/or intelligence.

two non-trained tasks were also included: backwards digit span for WM, and a face-emory task. 

Participants were recruited from 4 age groups:
young adolescents, 11-13
midadolescents, 13-15
older adolescents, 16-18
adults, 18-33 (note that this is a much wider range...)


The main hypotheses were:
1. training would improve performance on the same tas
2. the strength of improvement will differ between age groups
3. there may be transfer effects 
(side note, the hypotheses are somewhat vague, and more lioke questions to ask rather than directed hypotheses)


Generalised linear mixed-effects models were used for the anlaysis (using lme4).

It appears that there are significant training effects in the numerosity-discrimination and relational-reasonins tasks. 
the analyses suggest that the older age groups had larger training related boosts in performance on those tasks. Although this was particulatly present for the relational-reasoning task. 


Transfer effects:
no transfer effects were found. 

summary:
the study suggests that older individuals recieve a greater benefit in training from these tasks. Note that the tasks were set up in a similar manner to the adaptive n-back, i.e. that the difficulty increased as performance increased. Although it is worth noting that the accuracy rates assessed therefore, may be less comparible across participants compared to the average difficulty level achieved, for example. 

it is possible that the related brain areas to the numeracy related skills tested with the first two tasks are also those that continue development into adulthood. 


In short, the study found that the addumption that earlier is better for cognitive training may be a false assumption. they argue that late adolescence may be a better window of opportunity.

	abstract = {Cognitive models posit that social anxiety disorder (SAD) is associated with and maintained by biased attention allocation vis-√†-vis social threat. However, over the last decade, there has been intense debate regarding whether AB in SAD results from preferential engagement with or difficulty in disengaging from social threat. Further, recent evidence suggests that AB may merely result from top-down attentional impairments vis-√†-vis non-emotional material. Consequently, uncertainty still abounds regarding both the relative importance and the mutual interactions of these different processes and SAD symptoms. Inspired by novel network approaches to psychopathology that conceptualize symptoms as complex dynamic systems of mutually interacting variables, we computed weighted directed networks to investigate potential causal relations among laboratory measures of attentional components and symptoms of social anxiety disorder. Global and local connectivity of network structures revealed that the three most central variables were the orienting component of attention as well as both avoidance and fear of social situations. Neither preferential attention engagement with threat nor difficulty disengaging from threat exhibited high relative importance as predictors of symptoms in the network. Together, these findings suggest the value of extending the network approach beyond self-reported clinical symptoms to incorporate process-level measures from laboratory tasks to gain new insight into the mechanisms of SAD.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: If most adults with mental disorders are found to have a juvenile psychiatric history, this would shift etiologic research and prevention policy to focus more on childhood mental disorders. METHOD: Our prospective longitudinal study followed up a representative birth cohort (N = 1037). We made psychiatric diagnoses according to DSM criteria at 11, 13, 15, 18, 21, and 26 years of age. Adult disorders were defined in the following 3 ways: (1) cases diagnosed using a standardized diagnostic interview, (2) the subset using treatment, and (3) the subset receiving intensive mental health services. Follow-back analyses ascertained the proportion of adult cases who had juvenile diagnoses and the types of juvenile diagnoses they had. RESULTS: Among adult cases defined via the Diagnostic Interview Schedule, 73.9\% had received a diagnosis before 18 years of age and 50.0\% before 15 years of age. Among treatment-using cases, 76.5\% received a diagnosis before 18 years of age and 57.5\% before 15 years of age. Among cases receiving intensive mental health services, 77.9\% received a diagnosis before 18 years of age and 60.3\% before 15 years of age. Adult disorders were generally preceded by their juvenile counterparts (eg, adult anxiety was preceded by juvenile anxiety), but also by different disorders. Specifically, adult anxiety and schizophreniform disorders were preceded by a broad array of juvenile disorders. For all adult disorders, 25\% to 60\% of cases had a history of conduct and/or oppositional defiant disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Most adult disorders should be reframed as extensions of juvenile disorders. In particular, juvenile conduct disorder is a priority prevention target for reducing psychiatric disorder in the adult population.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Life-threatening danger is assumed to produce, in tandem, increases in both vigilance toward threat and stress-related symptoms, but no data test the validity of this assumption. The authors examined associations, in real time, among imminent life-threatening danger, stress-related symptoms, and vigilance. METHOD: Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety were measured in a civilian population (N=131) as a function of war-related stress, operationalized as the time available for seeking cover from rocket attack. A computerized measure of threat-related vigilance using a classic dot-probe attention task was also collected. RESULTS: PTSD symptoms, depression, and anxiety increased as a function of war-related threat. Acute proximal threat was associated with avoidance of, rather than vigilance toward, negative valence information. For participants within rocket range, the magnitude of threat bias varied with the magnitude of distress symptoms, such that as bias away from threat increased, distress symptoms increased. CONCLUSIONS: These data challenge current thinking about the role of attention in stress responding. Attentional threat avoidance may reduce the acute impact of imminent threat, but this may come at a price in terms of an elevated risk for psychopathology.},

Most clinicians seem to favor the first view, differing only in whether they conceptualize PTSD as a discrete category or the upper end of a dimension of stress responsiveness. Yet both categorical and dimensional construals presuppose that PTSD symptoms are fallible indicators reflective of an underlying, latent variable. This presupposition has governed psychopathology research for decades, but it rests on problematic psychometric premises. In this article, we review an alternative, network perspective for conceptualizing mental disorders as causal systems of interacting symptoms, and we illustrate this perspective via analyses of PTSD symptoms reported by survivors of the Wenchuan earthquake in China. Finally, we foreshadow emerging computational methods that may disclose the causal structure of mental disorders.},

The psychometric properties of several tasks measuring these biases and their associations with anxiety were examined in an unselected sample of 9-year-old children (N= 155). In each task, threat bias was assessed using bias scores reflecting task performance on threat versus non-threat conditions. Reliability was assessed using split-half and test-retest correlations of mean reaction times (RTs), accuracy and bias indices. Convergence between measures was also examined. Mean RTs showed substantial split-half and test-retest correlations. Bias score reliability coefficients were near zero and non-significant, suggesting poor reliability in children of this age. Additionally, associations between bias scores and anxiety were weak and inconsistent and performance between tasks showed little convergence. Bias scores from RT based paradigms in the current study lacked adequate psychometric properties for measuring individual differences in anxiety-related information-processing in children. ?? 2013 The Authors.},

The current study assessed the reliability and convergent validity of dot probe and emotional cueing bias scores in high-anxious and low-anxious participants in the context of a state anxiety manipulation to increase the likeli- hood of producing large, potentially reliable attentional biases. One hundred sixty participants completed an anxious or calm mood induction followed by dot probe and emotional cueing tasks. Reliability estimates for bias scores in the full sample were low, ranging from 0 to .44; convergent validity estimates were also poor. The anxiety induction did not substantially improve the reliability or validity of themeasures.

In 2005, Schmukle published very poor reliability estimates for two versions of the dot-probe task using words and situational images as stimuli. The present study tested the reliability of two versions of the test, using photographs of human faces. One version was similar to previous research, while the other was a modification designed to meet a potential methodo- logical issue. Results indicate that both versions tested were unreliable and therefore unsuitable for individual differences research. When considered as a group, however, participants showed consistent attentional bias towards emotional faces in the task similar to previous research, while habituation effects were found in the modified task. This suggests that the two tasks may be used in between-group designs to investigate different aspects of attention to emotional faces. Key},

Dysphoria was assessed in the lab, and then attentional bias was measured with a dot-probe task before and after a negative mood induction. Mood recovery following the induction was also assessed. Seven weeks later, dysphoria and intervening life stress were measured. Prior shifts in attention toward negative information following a negative mood induction interacted with intervening life stress to predict increases in dysphoria 7 weeks later. Slower mood recovery following the mood induction also combined with intervening life stress to predict increased dysphoria at follow-up. These vulnerabilities each explained unique variance in follow-up dysphoria. Results suggest that both attentional bias and mood persistence may have significant roles in depression susceptibility.

Probes always replaced the positive face, and subjects pushed a button to indicate the identity of the probe (E or F) as rapidly as possible. In the inverse condition, the probes always replaced the negative face, and in the control condition, the probes replaced each face type equally often. After four training sessions, all groups exhibited statistically indistinguishable, but significant, reductions on self-report, behavioral, and physiological measures of speech anxiety. Self-report and behavioral measures of attentional control improved likewise.

The Experience-Sampling Method (ESM) is an attempt to provide a valid instrument to describe variations in self-reports of mental processes. It can be used to obtain empirical data on the following types of variables: a) frequency and patterning of daily activity, social interaction, and changes in location; b) frequency, intensity, and patterning of psychological states, i.e., emotional, cognitive, and conative dimensions of experience; c) frequency and patterning of thoughts, including quality and intensity of thought disturbance. The article reviews pratical and methodological issues of the ESM and presents evidence for its short-and long-term reliability when used as an instrument for assessing the variables outlined above. It also presents evidence for validity by showing correlation between ESM measures on the one hand and physiological measures, one-time psychological tests, and behavioral indices on the other. A number of studies with normal and clinical populations that have used the ESM are reviewed to demonstrate the range of issues to which the technique can be usefully applied},

	abstract = {Previous research has established that high levels of trait anxiety commonly are associated with an automatic pattern of encoding selectivity, operating to favour the processing of emotionally threatening information. It has been suggested that this processing bias may play a functional role in mediating emotional vulnerability by moderating affective responses to stressful real life events. The current experiment employs a longitudinal design, capable of addressing the central predictions arising from this theoretical position. Thirty-one women awaiting colposcopy investigation were screened on both traditional questionnaire measures of emotional vulnerability, and on a modified emotional Stroop task that provided objective indices of their automatic and strategic patterns of processing selectivity. Subsequently, those 15 women who later received a diagnosis of cervical pathology reported the degree to which this diagnosis had impaired their level of emotional functioning. The results confirm that, at the initial test time, trait anxiety was indeed associated with an apparently automatic tendency to selectively process threat related distractor information. Furthermore, an index of this initial pattern of automatic processing selectivity was consistently the best predictor of the intensity of emotional distress elicited by the subsequent diagnosis of cervical pathology. None of our conventional questionnaire measures were capable of significantly predicting this later emotional response. We suggest that these findings offer empirical support for the hypotheses that patterns of automatic processing selectivity may moderate individuals' emotional responses to stressful life events. ¬© 1992.},

	abstract = {An analysis of the reported experiences of people involved in various play-forms (i.e., rock-climbing, chess, dance, basketball, music composi- tion) suggests that the qualities which make these activities enjoyable are the following: (a) a person is able to concentrate on a limited stimulus field, (o) in which he or she can use his or her skills to meet clear demands, (c) thereby forgetting his or her own problems, and (d) his or her own separate identity, (e) at the same time obtaining a feeling of control over the environment, Q which may result in a transcendence of ego-boundaries and consequent psychic integration with metapersonal systems A formal analysis is carried out to establish what are the characteristics that an activity must have to provide such intrinsically rewarding experiences.

The purpose of this study is to investigate distinct feature of worry and rumination in factor structure and their predictive validity for the diagnosis of GAD and MDD.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODS: Four hundred and sixty-eight patients with GAD (n=148) and MDD (n=320) were enrolled and the diagnoses were confirmed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I). Participants completed the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) and Ruminative Response Scale (RRS) and the severity of anxiety and depressive symptoms was assessed via clinician ratings.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: In joint factor analysis using PSWQ and RRS items, worry and rumination emerged as distinct factors. In logistic regression analyses, worry contributed to a higher probability of the diagnosis of GAD than rumination, as rumination did in MDD than worry.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSION: This is the first comprehensive study investigating the diagnostic utility of worry and rumination in a well-defined clinical sample of both GAD and MDD. Our results suggest that worry and rumination are distinct cognitive processes and play a differential role in the diagnosis of GAD and MDD, distinguishing them at the cognitive level.},

Rumination has been found to mediate cross-sectional and prospective relations between anxiety and depressive symptoms in adolescents and adults. We examined whether rumination and worry, both forms of repetitive negative thinking, also explain the associations between affective disorders. This was studied using a prospective cohort study. In a mixed sample of 2981 adults (persons with a prior history of or a current affective disorder and healthy individuals) we assessed DSM-IV affective disorders (CIDI), rumination (LEIDS-R) and worry (PSWQ). All measures were repeated 2 years and 4 years later. Using structural equation models, we found that baseline rumination and worry partly mediated the association of baseline fear disorders (social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia) with distress disorders (dysthymia, major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder). Moreover, baseline fear disorders predicted changes in distress disorders and changes in worry and rumination mediated these associations. The association between baseline distress disorders and changes in fear disorders was mediated by changes in rumination but not by changes in worry. From these results it can be concluded that repetitive negative thinking is an important transdiagnostic factor. Rumination and worry are partly responsible for the cross-sectional and prospective co-occurrence of affective disorders and may be suitable targets for treatment.},

As a proof-of-principle study with an unselected student sample, this positive training (PT; N = 44) was compared to a negative training (NT; N = 42), which reinforced the opposite attentional pattern. Importantly, training trials were completed only if participants performed the correct gaze patterns. Results showed that higher depression levels were associated with slower disengagement from negative stimuli at baseline. As expected, the PT induced longer fixations on positive pictures and faster disengagement from negative pictures. The NT showed no changes in attentional processes. The groups did not differ in mood reactivity and recovery from a stressor. Advantages of using eye-tracking in ABM and potential applications of the training are discussed.},

In patients (n = 40), repetitive thought was positively correlated with anxiety and depression, and rumination was also specifically correlated with depression. Study 2 was a pro- spective test of the hypothesis. In students (n = 90), there were significant cross- sectional relationships between repetitive thought and both anxiety and depression. In addition, repetitive thought at least partially predicted maintenance of anxious symptoms.

Interestingly, both rumination and worry correlated more substantially with anxiety symptoms than with depression symptoms. Finally, worry emerged as a unique predictor of anxiety symptoms, even when controlling for rumination.

These impairments may be associated with reduced capacity to actively maintain relevant information to facilitate goal-directed behaviour. In light of mixed data from behavioural studies, the current study using direct neural measurement, examines whether dysphoric individuals show poor filtering of irrelevant information and reduced working memory (WM) capacity for relevant information. Consistent with previous research, a sustained event-related potential (ERP) asymmetry, termed contra-lateral delay activity (CDA), was observed to be sensitive to WM capacity and the efficient filtering of irrelevant information from visual WM. We found a strong positive correlation between the efficiency of filtering irrelevant items and visual WM capacity. Specifically, dysphoric participants were poor at filtering irrelevant information, and showed reduced WM capacity relative to high capacity non-dysphoric participants. Results support the hypothesis that impaired inhibition is a central feature of dysphoria and are discussed within the framework of cognitive and neurophysiological models of depression.},

Their interplay was assessed using the modified version of the Flexible Item Selection Task (FIST; Jacques and Zelazo 2001) with non-emotional stimuli (geometrical shapes) and the Emotional FIST (EM-FIST) with emotional stimuli (emotional facial expressions). Performance on the EM-FIST indicated that across the whole age range, trials requiring greater cognitive flexibility were more demanding than nonflexible ones, as revealed by both response time and accuracy performance. Moreover, flexibility demands were higher for younger children than for older ones but only in terms of response speed. Individual differences in trait anxiety moderated the impact of flexibility only on the EM-FIST. Being flexible on the EM-FIST was more demanding for high trait anxious children than for their low trait anxious peers. Lastly, overall girls responded faster than boys, but only in the EM-FIST. These findings extend the presently limited literature concerning variability in cognitive-affective flexibility during this sensitive developmental window.},

The main unconstructive consequences of RT are (a) depression, (b) anxiety, and (c) difficulties in physical health. The main constructive consequences of RT are (a) recovery from upsetting and traumatic events, (b) adaptive preparation and anticipatory planning, (c) recovery from depression, and (d) uptake of health-promoting behaviors. Several potential principles accounting for these distinct consequences of RT are identified within this review: (a) the valence of thought content, (b) the intrapersonal and situational context in which RT occurs, and (c) the level of construal (abstract vs. concrete processing) adopted during RT. Of the existing models of RT, it is proposed that an elaborated version of the control theory account provides the best theoretical framework to account for its distinct consequences. Repetitive, prolonged, and recurrent thought about one's self, one's concerns and one's experiences is a mental process com-monly engaged in by all people (Harvey, Watkins, Mansell, \& Shafran, 2004).

	abstract = {The current paper provides an updated review of repetitive negative thinking as a transdiagnostic process. It is shown that elevated levels of repetitive negative thinking are present across a large range of Axis I disorders and appear to be causally involved in the maintenance of emotional problems. As direct comparisons of repetitive negative thinking between different disorders (e.g., GAD‚Äìtype worry and depressive rumina-tion) have generally revealed more similarities than differences, it is argued that repeti-tive negative thinking is characterized by the same process across disorders, which is applied to a disorder‚Äìspecific content. On the other hand, there is some evidence that‚Äîwithin given disorders‚Äîrepetitive negative thinking can be reliably distin-guished from other forms of recurrent cognitions, such as obsessions, intrusive memo-ries or functional forms of repeated thinking. An agenda for future research on repetitive negative thinking from a transdiagnostic perspective is presented. Individuals with different emotional disorders report excessive and repetitive thinking about their current concerns, problems, past experiences or worries about the future. Such repetitive negative thinking (RNT) is found across diverse problems including af-fective disorders, anxiety disorders, insomnia or psychosis, which is why Harvey and colleagues (2004) proposed RNT as a definite transdiagnostic process. The aim of the present article will be to provide an update on the earlier review by Harvey et al. (2004). This update appears timely as there has been an increase in studies investigating RNT in different emotional disorders in recent years, with more than 50 new empirical studies since the Harvey et al. (2004) review. In addition to reviewing the current evidence for the presence of RNT across disorders, this review will furthermore aim to (a) propose a working definition of this process, (b) summarize the results of studies that have directly compared different forms of repetitive negative thinking, (c) describe characteristics of repetitive negative thinking across disorders, (d) summarize evidence regarding the 192},

this section is pretty perfect to use as source material for the RNT induction in the grant proposal.(note on p. 5)
good to note that the induction procedure was successful in producing between-subjects differences in worry, state anxiety etc.(note on p. 6)
this is also a good point as it shows that the manipulation continues throughout the post-induction task(note on p. 6)
good things to check for in the manipulaions(note on p. 6)
this is kind of what I am looking to do in the grant(note on p. 8)},
	annote = {The authors describe the expected impact of active worry on working memory, which would be expected to explain the impaired or inefficient task performance in anxiety.

They ensured that participants practiced the task so that performance was greater than 50\% before starting the main experiment. 

The worry induction was asking to think of a personally relevant future event that was a concern or worrisome event - whereas in the control it was a positive event (this followed Stefanopoulou et al., 2014). Participants are then "interviewed" about these events for about two minutes. Specifically asked to discuss the positive or nagative aspects of the events that they were focussing on. They are then told to keep on thinking about the future events they described until the end of the experiment. they then gave mood ratings (also gave mood ratings before this part of the study).


The mediation analyses used a bootstrapping approach (see Preacher \& Hayes, 2008 and Hayes, 2013) in order to increase the stability of results. I should investigate more into bootstrapping approaches myself for things like the ERP and eye-tracking analyses. 

The results suggest that worry mediated the relationship between condition and WMC change. Similarly VAS anxiety and state anxiety mediated the relationship between condition and WMC change.

follow up analyses revealed that the longer the participants thought about their worrying topic, the greater teh reduction in WMC, but not in the control condition.

look up Hayes Hirsch and Mathews 2008
and Stefanopoulu et al, 2014 for studies on worry vs control conditions affecting executive control and WM.},

Adaptive WM training and mindfulness meditation practice (MMP) have both shown potential to increase attentional control. The present study hence investigates the individual and combined effects of MMP and a dual adaptive n-back task on a non-clinical, randomised sample of high worriers. 60 participants were tested before and after seven days of training. Assessment included self-report questionnaires, as well as performance tasks measuring attentional control and working memory capacity. Combined training resulted in continued reduction in worry in the week after training, highlighting the potential of utilising n-back training as an adjunct to established clinical treatment. Engagement with WM training correlated with immediate improvements in attentional control and resilience, with worry decreasing over time.

Here, we investigated this effect while varying the level of cognitive load in a modified antisaccade task that employed emotional facial expressions (neutral, happy, and angry) as targets. Load was manipulated using a secondary auditory task requiring recognition of tones (low load), or recognition of specific tone pitch (high load). Results showed that load increased antisaccade latencies on trials where gaze toward face stimuli should be inhibited. This effect was exacerbated for high anxious individuals. Emotional expression also modulated task performance on antisaccade trials for both high and low anxious participants under low cognitive load, but did not influence performance under high load. Collectively, results (1) suggest that individuals reporting high levels of anxiety are particularly vulnerable to the effects of cognitive load on inhibition, and (2) support recent evidence that loading cognitive processes can reduce emotional influences on attention and cognition.},

However, it is unclear how such cognitive control deficits are modulated by task demands and by the emotionality of the distractors. A sample of 31 participants (25 female) completed a novel flanker task with emotional and neutral distractors under low- and high-cognitive-load conditions. The negative-going N2 event-related potential was measured to index participants' level of top-down resource allocation in the inhibition of distractors under high- and low-load conditions. Results showed N2 amplitudes were larger under high- compared with low-load conditions. In addition, under high but not low load, trait worry was associated with greater N2 amplitudes. Our findings support ACT predictions that trait worry adversely affects goal-directed behavior, and is associated with greater recruitment of cognitive resources to inhibit the impact of distracting information under conditions in which cognitive resources are taxed.

The high rate of recurrance in adolescent MDD is argued to reflect the presence of stable vulnerability factors. 

The results essentially suggest that current and remitted depressive adolescents show similar levels of pupillary and neural reactivity to facial displays of emotion. Although it was expected that this would be negative emotional stimuli specific, there was not evidence for this specificity. 

They raise the interesting idea of schematic interconnectedness (Dozois, 2014) which is the idea that you will only observe strong relationships at multiple levels of analysis when that cognitive schema is activated, e.g. as in the MDD group.

Notes more specifically for the grant


"Compared to behavioral findings, neural and psychophysiological measures can provide relatively objective measures of emotion processing and offer insight into the brain circuitry underlying vulnerability."

both have been shown to predict future depression onset amongst at risk for depression adolescents. 

Pupil dilation
the pupil dilates in response to stimuli requiring greater cognitive load and attentional responses and to more emotionally intense stimuli, remaining dilated while processing persists, giving a nice peripheral index of brain activation (see Laeng et al, 2012 for review)
Siegel et al 2001 and 2003a for increased dilation to negative stimuli in MDD vs controls
Burkhouse et al. 2015 found that greater pupil dilation to sad faces amongst high risk youth (depressed mother) prospectively predicted depression onset over a 2-year longitudinal follow-up period.

ERP
ensure that i make a note of ERPs excellent temporal resolution and ability to capture multiple stages of emotional processing.

Another major theoretical assumption is that anxiety impairs performance effectiveness (the quality of performance) to a lesser extent than processing efficiency (the relationship between performance effectiveness and effort or use of processing resources). However, there may be conditions (e.g., prior presentation of threat-related stimuli) in which that assumption is not applicable. The extensive recent research (including several cognitive neuroscience studies) of direct relevance to the theory is discussed, and suggestions are made for maximizing the value of future cognitive neuroscience research.

Accumulating evidence (see Derakshan\&Eysenck, 2009) indicates that anxiety results in longer antisaccade latencies, supporting the prediction that anxiety impairs inhibition and efficient top-down attention regulation. However, any observed variance in antisaccade performance permits interpretations of inhibition and saccade generation, questioning direct inferences about these processes in isolation. The current study used a ‚Äò‚Äòdelayed‚Äô‚Äô antisaccade task where participants were instructed to maintain central fixation despite the onset of the abrupt stimulus and only generate an antisaccade upon hearing a tone. Here, impaired performance reflects a weakness in volitional saccade generation as the simultaneous need to inhibit is eliminated by the delay. High-anxious individuals exhibited comparable antisaccade latencies to low-anxious ones when the delay was introduced suggesting that longer antisaccade latencies previously observed in the high anxious cannot be attributed to impairments in volitional saccade generation, i.e., action control.

Our results showed that anxiety resulted in faster antisaccade latencies during medium compared with short and long CTIs. Accordingly, high-anxious individuals compared with low-anxious individuals showed greater levels of CNV activity at frontal sites during medium CTI suggesting that they exerted greater cognitive effort and invested more attentional resources in preparation for the task goal.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the concurrent validity and reliability of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents (MINI-KID), a short structured diagnostic interview for DSM-IV and ICD-10 psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents. METHOD: Participants were 226 children and adolescents (190 outpatients and 36 controls) aged 6 to 17 years. To assess the concurrent validity of the MINI-KID, participants were administered the MINI-KID and the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Aged Children-Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL) by blinded interviewers in a counterbalanced order on the same day. Participants also completed a self-rated measure of disability. In addition, interrater (n = 57) and test-retest (n = 83) reliability data (retest interval, 1-5 days) were collected, and agreement between the parent version of the MINI-KID and the standard MINI-KID (n = 140) was assessed. Data were collected between March 2004 and January 2008. RESULTS: Substantial to excellent MINI-KID to K-SADS-PL concordance was found for syndromal diagnoses of any mood disorder, any anxiety disorder, any substance use disorder, any ADHD or behavioral disorder, and any eating disorder (area under curve [AUC] = 0.81-0.96, kappa = 0.56-0.87). Results were more variable for psychotic disorder (AUC = 0.94, kappa = 0.41). Sensitivity was substantial (0.61-1.00) for 15/20 individual DSM-IV disorders. Specificity was excellent (0.81-1.00) for 18 disorders and substantial ({\textgreater} 0.73) for the remaining 2. The MINI-KID identified a median of 3 disorders per subject compared to 2 on the K-SADS-PL and took two-thirds less time to administer (34 vs 103 minutes). Interrater and test-retest kappas were substantial to almost perfect (0.64-1.00) for all individual MINI-KID disorders except dysthymia. Concordance of the parent version (MINI-KID-P) with the standard MINI-KID was good.

Individuals diagnosed with GAD and healthy participants (HPs) performed a random key-pressing task while thinking about a worrisome or a positive future event, to assess the extent to which attentional control resources are used by worry. Attentional control was also assessed when participants were not instructed to think about a specific topic using the N-back task, which varies in task difficulty, and therefore is sensitive to subtle differences in ability to handle increasing demands on attentional control within the same paradigm. GAD participants (but not HPs) were less random while worrying than thinking about a positive event during the key-pressing task, suggesting that worry consumed more attentional control resources in this population. During the N-Back task, GAD participants performed worse than HPs during the high load conditions only, indicating greater difficulty in sustaining focus on conditions requiring a higher degree of attentional control, even without concurrent task activity. Poor attentional control might underpin the difficulty of GAD individuals to stop worrying and switch to thinking more benign information. Further research could investigate whether worry consumes attentional control resources in other psychological disorders with high rates of worry (e.g., panic disorder, psychosis), as well as the extent to which attentional control is used by other forms of repetitive thinking, such as depressive rumination.},

Consequently, the quality of the questionnaires used in medical education research is highly variable. To address this problem, this AMEE Guide presents a systematic, seven-step process for designing high-quality questionnaires, with particular emphasis on developing survey scales. These seven steps do not address all aspects of survey design, nor do they represent the only way to develop a high-quality questionnaire. Instead, these steps synthesize multiple survey design techniques and organize them into a cohesive process for questionnaire developers of all levels. Addressing each of these steps systematically will improve the probabilities that survey designers will accurately measure what they intend to measure.},

Interestingly, the analysis found the items of the AAQ-II to be more strongly related to items designed to measure distress than items designed to measure acceptance/nonacceptance with minimal references to functional outcomes. The results of the study are interpreted and discussed in relation to the widespread use of the AAQ in both clinical and scientific contexts and given the centrality of the measure in empirically validating the ACT model of psychopathology and treatment.},

Cognitive bias modification of interpretations (CBM-I) training aims to alter information biases associated with anxiety disorders by training the person to endorse benign, rather than negative, interpretations of ambiguous situations. With an expanding evidence base, CBM-I training in childhood and adolescence may provide a key opportunity to prevent the development of anxiety disorders, particularly by capitalizing on the inherent flexibility of the adolescent brain to make durable changes. This article augments existing data with a reanalysis of a large sample of data (N = 387). The reanalysis highlights that CBM-I is (a) effective in altering interpretation styles; (b) that changes in mood state, although weak, are evident; and (c) tentatively, that effectiveness may vary across age in males and females. We conclude by offering further suggestions on which factors associated with protocol (e.g., multiple sessions) and training package (e.g., use of imagery) may maximize training effectiveness.},

	abstract = {Background: Depression is the most common psychiatric disorder in adolescence, and is characterised by an inability to down-regulate negative emotional responses to stress. Adult studies suggest this may be associated with reduced functional connectivity between prefrontal and subcortical regions, yet the neurological mechanisms in adolescence remain unclear. Methods: We developed a novel, age-appropriate, reappraisal paradigm to investigate functional connectivity during reappraisal of a real-life source of stress in 15 depressed and 15 non-depressed adolescents. During fMRI, participants i) attended to, and ii) implemented reappraisal techniques (learnt prior to fMRI) in response to, rejection. Results: Reappraisal reduced negative mood and belief in negative thoughts in both groups alike, however during reappraisal (versus attend) trials, depressed adolescents showed greater connectivity between the right frontal pole and numerous subcortical and cortical regions than non-depressed adolescents. Conclusions: These findings tentatively suggest that, when instructed, depressed adolescents do have the ability to engage neural networks involved in emotion regulation, possibly because adolescence reflects a period of heightened plasticity. These data support the value of cognitive reappraisal as a treatment tool, identify neural markers that could be used to optimise current therapies, and lay the foundations for developing novel neuroscientific techniques for the treatment of adolescent depression.},

	abstract = {Background: Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM) has been shown to change interpretation biases commonly associated with anxiety and depression and may help ameliorate symptoms of these disorders. However, its evidence base for adolescents is scarce. Previous results have been hard to interpret because of methodological issues. In particular, many studies have used negative bias training as the control condition. This would tend to inflate any apparent benefits of CBM compared to a neutral control. Most studies also only examined the effects of a single training session and lacked follow-up assessment or ecologically valid outcome measures. Method: Seventy-four adolescents, aged 16‚Äì18 years, were randomised to two sessions of CBM training or neutral control. Interpretation bias and mood were assessed three times: at baseline, immediately post-training and 1 week post-training. A controlled experimental stressor was also used, and responses to everyday stressors were recorded for 1 week after training to assess responses to psychological challenges. Feedback for the training programme was collected. Results: The CBM group reported a greater reduction in negative affect than control participants. However, other hypothesised advantages of CBM were not demonstrated. Regardless of training group, participants reported increased positive interpretations, decreased negative interpretations, reduced depressive symptoms and no change in trait anxiety. The two groups did not differ in their stress reactivity. After controlling for group differences in training performance, all the mood effects disappeared. Conclusions: When tested under stringent experimental conditions the effects of CBM in healthy adolescents appear to be minimal. Future studies should concentrate on participants with elevated cognitive biases and/or mood symptoms who may be more sensitive to CBM.},

	abstract = {That emotions change in response to emotion-eliciting events is a natural part of human life. However, it is equally important for emotions to return to baseline once the emotion-eliciting events have passed. This suggests that the ability to emotionally react to and recover from emotion-eliciting events is critical for healthy psychological functioning. But why do individuals differ in their emotion reactivity and recovery? The present work postulates that the ability to update emotional information in working memory (WM) may explain individual differences in emotion reactivity and recovery. Two studies are presented, which examined whether updating ability was related to emotion reactivity and recovery. In Study 1, we assessed participants' self-reported affect as they viewed negative and positive films. Our results revealed that better updating ability was related to greater emotion reactivity and facilitated (i.e., quicker) recovery from watching negative films. In Study 2, participants recalled a recent angering event, and were then instructed to either ruminate about or reappraise the event. Results revealed that updating ability was again related to greater emotion reactivity and facilitated (i.e., successful) emotion recovery in response to the angering event, and that this was unrelated to the emotion regulation strategy used. These findings identify the ability to update emotional information in WM as a possible mechanism in emotion responding.},

	abstract = {Flexibility in self-regulatory behaviors has proved to be an important quality for adjusting to stressful life events and requires individuals to have a diverse repertoire of emotion regulation abilities. However, the most commonly used emotion regulation questionnaires assess frequency of behavior rather than ability, with little evidence linking these measures to observable capacity to enact a behavior. The aim of the current investigation was to develop and validate a Flexible Regulation of Emotional Expression (FREE) Scale that measures a person‚Äôs ability to enhance and suppress displayed emotion across an array of hypothetical contexts. In Studies 1 and 2, a series of confirmatory factor analyses revealed that the FREE Scale consists of 4 first-order factors divided by regulation and emotional valence type that can contribute to 2 higher order factors: expressive enhancement ability and suppression ability. In Study 1, we also compared the FREE Scale to other commonly used emotion regulation measures, which revealed that suppression ability is conceptually distinct from suppression frequency. In Study 3, we compared the FREE Scale with a composite of traditional frequency-based indices of expressive regulation to predict performance in a previously validated emotional modulation paradigm. Participants‚Äô enhancement and suppression ability scores on the FREE Scale predicted their corresponding performance on the laboratory task, even when controlling for baseline expressiveness. These studies suggest that the FREE Scale is a valid and flexible measure of expressive regulation ability. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved)},

At a pre-conscious level, these processes influence the competition between mental representations when some correspond to the intended focus of attention and others to threat distracters. Processing biases influence the probability of threat representations initially intruding into awareness as negative thoughts. Worry in predominantly verbal form then develops, influenced by conscious processes such as attempts to resolve the perceived threat and the redirection of attentional control resources to worry content, as well as the continuing influence of habitual processing biases. After describing this model, we present evidence for each component process and for their causal role in pathological worry, together with implications for new directions in the treatment of pathological worry. ?? 2012.},

Using a Monte Carlo simulation, the authors demonstrate that a higher level of unreliability in such dependent variables is associated with substantially lower levels of replicability.

	abstract = {Behavioral medicine research often seeks to examine relatively complex theoretical models and clinical processes. Traditional designs, based on retrospective self-report in the natural environment or laboratory-based studies, cannot assess complex and temporally dynamic psychological, behavioral, and physiological processes in the natural environment. An alternate research approach, Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), provides a method to collect such data. This research approach and these data allow investigation of a number of research questions not amenable to other data collection methods. Examples of research questions uniquely suited for EMA data include, but are not limited to: (1) the comparison of retrospective data to momentary data; (2) evaluation of physiological and psychosocial processes in the natural environment; (3) the relation of symptoms and other disease processes to characteristics of the natural environment; and (4) examination of dynamic changes in psychosocial variables that may mediate improvement following treatment. Despite the strengths of EMA data, a number of challenges exist including logistic, analytic, and interpretation problems to the easy implementation of EMA approaches in behavioral medicine.

One hundred thirty-seven college students performed a set of relatively simple experimental tasks that are considered to predominantly tap each target executive function as well as a set of frequently used executive tasks: the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), Tower of Hanoi (TOH), random number generation (RNG), operation span, and dual tasking. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the three target executive functions are moderately correlated with one another, but are clearly separable. Moreover, structural equation modeling suggested that the three functions contribute differentially to performance on complex executive tasks. Specifically, WCST performance was related most strongly to Shifting, TOH to Inhibition, RNG to Inhibition and Updating, and operation span to Updating. Dual task performance was not related to any of the three target functions. These results suggest that it is important to recognize both the unity and diversity of executive functions and that latent variable analysis is a useful approach to studying the organization and roles of executive functions.},

However, various forms of RNT such as worry, rumination, and post-event processing have been assessed using separate measures and have almost exclusively been examined within the anxiety, depression, and social phobia literatures, respectively. A single transdiagnostic measure of RNT would facilitate the identification of transdiagnostic maintaining factors of RNT, and would be more efficient than administering separate measures for each disorder. Items from three existing measures of RNT were modified to remove diagnosis-specific content and administered to a sample of undergraduate students (N=284). Exploratory factor analysis yielded two factors labeled Repetitive Negative Thinking and Absence of Repetitive Thinking (ART). The RNT scale demonstrated high internal reliability and was associated with anxiety, depression, anger, shame, and general distress. Moreover, the RNT scale was associated with constructs that are theoretically related to engagement in RNT, including positive and negative metacognitions, cognitive avoidance, thought suppression, and thought control strategies. The ART scale had little predictive utility. Theoretical and clinical implications are discussed. ¬© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Worry and depressive rumination have been found to be involved in the onset and maintenance of a range of psychological disorders. The development of brief screening measures for excessive worry and depressive rumination is therefore desirable to facilitate the assessment of worry and rumination in prevention and treatment settings where routine administration of full questionnaires is not practical due to time-related constraints.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nDESIGN AND METHODS: Using the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) and the Ruminative Response Scale (RRS) as gold standard starting points, brief versions of these measures were developed in a large sample of adolescents (N = 1,952) and results were cross-validated in two independent samples (N = 1,954; N = 457).{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: The brief versions demonstrated acceptable to high internal consistency (brief PSWQ: Œ± = .84-.91; brief RRS: Œ± = .78-.81) and correlated highly with the full questionnaires (brief PSWQ: r = .91-.94; brief RRS: r = .88-.91). In addition, they showed high sensitivity (brief PSWQ: .90-.92; brief RRS: .90-.93), and high specificity (brief PSWQ: .88-.90; brief RRS: .80-.87) to detect excessive worry and rumination. The validity of the brief measures was further supported by demonstrating that the brief measures showed similar differences in scores between males and females as the full measures as well as substantial relationships to other measures of repetitive negative thinking and symptom measures of anxiety and depression. Finally, the brief measures predicted future symptoms of anxiety and depression.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: The brief versions of the PSWQ and RRS are time-efficient and valid instruments for the screening of worry and depressive rumination. Their use in clinical practice is recommended to inform treatment and/or to select individuals at risk for development of psychological disorders who may benefit from preventive interventions.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nPRACTITIONER POINTS: The newly developed brief PSWQ and brief RRS are valid, internally reliable measures that show high diagnostic efficiency to detect excessive worry and depressive rumination. The brief PSWQ and brief RRS are time-efficient instruments that can be used to determine whether a focus on reducing worry and depressive rumination during treatment is indicated. The brief PSWQ and brief RRS can be used for large-scale screening purposes to identify individuals eligible for targeted prevention programmes. A potential limitation is that items of the brief RRS have depressive item content which may inflate the observed association with depression. Future research is needed to assess the quality of the brief PSWQ and the brief RRS in broader community and clinical samples.},

	abstract = {n the light of continuing debate over the applications of significance testing in psychology journals and follow-ing the publication of Cohen's (1994) article, the Board of Scientific Affairs (BSA) of the American Psychological Association (APA) convened a committee called the Task Force on Statistical Inference (TFSI) whose charge was "to elucidate some of the controversial issues surrounding ap-plications of statistics including significance testing and its alternatives; alternative underlying models and data trans-formation; and newer methods made possible by powerful computers" (BSA, personal communication, February 28, 1996). Robert Rosenthal, Robert Abelson, and Jacob Co-hen (cochairs) met initially and agreed on the desirability of having several types of specialists on the task force: stat-isticians, teachers of statistics, journal editors, authors of statistics books, computer experts, and wise elders. Nine individuals were subsequently invited to join and all agreed. These were Tukey served as Senior Advisors to the Task Force and commented on written materials. The TFSI met twice in two years and corresponded throughout that period. After the first meeting, the task force circulated a preliminary report indicating its intention to examine issues beyond null hypothesis significance test-ing. The task force invited comments and used this feed-back in the deliberations during its second meeting. After the second meeting, the task force recommended several possibilities for further action, chief of which would be to revise the statistical sections of the American Psychological Association Publication Manual (APA, 1994). After extensive discussion, the BSA recommended that "before the TFSI undertook a revision of the APA Publication Manual, it might want to consider publishing an article in American Psychologist, as a way to initiate discussion in the field about changes in current practices of data analysis and reporting" (BSA, personal communica-tion, November 17, 1997). This report follows that request. The sections in italics are proposed guidelines that the TFSI recommends could be used for revising the APA publication manual or for developing other BSA supporting materials. Following each guideline are comments, explanations, or elaborations assembled by Leland Wilkinson for the task force and under its review. This report is concerned with the use of statistical methods only and is not meant as an assessment of research methods in general. Psychology is a broad science. Methods appropriate in one area may be inappro-priate in another. The title and format of this report are adapted from a similar article by Bailar and Mosteller (1988). That article should be consulted, because it overlaps somewhat with this one and discusses some issues relevant to research in psychology.

Probable error varies according to the method of calculation. While the number of Ss helps to reduce accidental deviation, it has no effect upon systematic deviation, except that it indirectly leads to an augmentation. Therefore, the number of cases should be determined by the principle that the measurements to be aggregated together should have their error brought to the same general order of magnitude.

The current experiments assessed the reliability of repetition priming within individuals. The results suggest that observed differences in the size of the repetition priming effect across participants are largely reliable and result primarily from systematic processes. We conclude that the unreliability of semantic priming observed by Stolz, Besner, and Carr (2005) is specific to uncoordinated processes in semantic memory, and that this unreliability does not generalize to other processes in visual word recognition. We consider the implications of these results for theories of automatic and controlled processes that contribute to priming. Finally, we emphasize the importance of reliability for researchers who use similar paradigms to study individual and group differences in cognition.},

	abstract = {A large proportion of research in social psychology uses self-report measures to assess socially relevant constructs, such as attitudes, stereo-types, self-concepts, and self-esteem. Over the past century, self-report measures have provided important insights that built the foundation for many prominent theories in the field. At the same time, there have been per-sistent concerns that self-report measures are suboptimal research tools for at least two reasons. First, responses on self-report measures are susceptible to self-presentation, which may distort measurement outcomes in socially sensitive domains (Crowne \& Marlowe, 1960; Paulhus, 1984). Second, there is consensus that many psychological processes operate outside of conscious awareness, which undermines the suitability of self-report mea-su.res to assess mental contents that are introspectively inaccessible (Nisbett \& Wilson, 1977). To overcome these problems, psychologists have devel-oped various indirect measurement procedures that (1) reduce participants' ability to control their responses, and (2) do not require introspection for the assessment of mental contents. This chapter reviews a particularly influential class of indirect mea-78 ' ‚Ä¢ ," Response Interference Tasks 79 surement procedures, namely, experimental paradigms based on response interference (RI). 1 For this purpose, we first provide a general context for our review of RI tasks by defining a number of relevant concepts and briefly describing the history of RI tasks in social psychology. After explaining the basic logic of RI, we then review different kinds of measures based on RI, including general information about their procedures, implementation, and scoring. We conclude our chapter with a discussion of general issues regarding the interpretation of RI effects and a pragmatically oriented com-parison of the reviewed tasks. \_Bask Co{\textasciitilde}cepts and Terminology},

Tests divisible into distinct subtests should be so divided before using the formula. The index \$\${\textbackslash}bar r\_\{ij\} \$\$ , derived from Œ±, is shown to be an index of inter-item homogeneity. Comparison is made to the Guttman and Loevinger approaches. Parallel split coefficients are shown to be unnecessary for tests of common types.

In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

	abstract = {The usage of psychological networks that conceptualize psychological behavior as a complex interplay of psychological and other components has gained increasing popularity in various fields of psychology. While prior publications have tackled the topics of estimating and interpreting such networks, little work has been conducted to check how accurate (i.e., prone to sampling variation) networks are estimated, and how stable (i.e., interpretation remains similar with less observations) inferences from the network structure (such as centrality indices) are. In this tutorial paper, we aim to introduce the reader to this field and tackle the problem of accuracy under sampling variation. We first introduce the current state-of-the-art of network estimation. Second, we provide a rationale why researchers should investigate the accuracy of psychological networks. Third, we describe how bootstrap routines can be used to (A) assess the accuracy of estimated network connections, (B) investigate the stability of centrality indices, and (C) test whether network connections and centrality estimates for different variables differ from each other. We introduce two novel statistical methods: for (B) the correlation stability coefficient, and for (C) the bootstrapped difference test for edge-weights and centrality indices. We conducted and present simulation studies to assess the performance of both methods. Finally, we developed the free R-package bootnet that allows for estimating psychological networks in a generalized framework in addition to the proposed bootstrap methods. We showcase bootnet in a tutorial, accompanied by R syntax, in which we analyze a dataset of 359 women with posttraumatic stress disorder available online.},

	abstract = {Background and objectives Attentional bias modification (ABM) is a potentially exciting new development in the treatment of anxiety disorders. However, reported therapeutic benefits have not always been replicated. To gauge the sensitivity of tasks used in ABM treatment and assessment, we used a counterbalanced within-subject design to measure their discriminant sensitivity to neutral and threatening facial expressions, comparing them with other well-known tasks that measure visual attention. Methods We compared two tasks often used in the assessment and treatment of attention bias (the dot-probe and the spatial cueing paradigms) with two well-known visual attention tasks (the irrelevant singleton and attentional blink paradigms), measuring their sensitivity to processing differences between threatening and neutral expressions for non-clinical observers. Results The dot-probe, spatial cueing and irrelevant singleton paradigms showed little or no sensitivity to processing differences between facial expressions while the attentional blink task proved very sensitive to such differences. Furthermore, the attentional blink task provided an intriguing picture of the temporal dynamics of attentional biases that the other paradigms cannot do. Limitations These results need to be replicated with larger samples, including a comparison of a group of individuals diagnosed with social anxiety disorder and normal controls. Conclusions Our results indicate that the sensitivity of putative attentional bias measures should be assessed experimentally for more powerful assessment and treatment of such biases. If the attentional blink task is indeed particularly sensitive to attentional biases, as our findings indicate, it is not unreasonable to expect that interventions based on this task may be more effective than those based on the tasks that are currently used.},

	doi = {10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01368},
	abstract = {The dot-probe task is often considered a gold standard in the field for investigating attentional bias to threat. However, serious issues with the task have been raised. Specifically, a number of studies have demonstrated that the traditional reaction time (RT) measure of attentional bias to threat in the dot-probe task has poor internal reliability and poor test-retest reliability. In addition, although threatening stimuli capture attention in other paradigms, attentional bias to threat has not usually been found in typical research participants in the dot-probe task. However, when attention is measured in the dot-probe task with the N2pc component of the event-related potential waveform, substantial attentional orienting to threat is observed, and the internal reliability is moderate. To provide a rigorous comparison of the reliability of this N2pc measure and the conventional behavioral measure, as well as to examine the relationship of these measures to anxiety, the present study examined the N2pc in conjunction with RT in the dot-probe task in a large sample of participants (N = 96). As in previous studies, RT showed no bias to threatening images across the sample and exhibited poor internal reliability. Moreover, this measure did not relate to trait anxiety. By contrast, the N2pc revealed a significant initial shift of attention to threat, and this measure was internally reliable. However, the N2pc was not correlated with trait anxiety, indicating that it does not provide a meaningful index of individual differences in anxiety in the dot-probe task. Together, these results indicate a serious need to develop new tasks and methods to more reliably investigate attentional bias to threat and its relationship to anxiety in both clinical and non-clinical populations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND New indices, calculated on data from the widely used Dot Probe Task, were recently proposed to capture variability in biased attention allocation. We observed that it remains unclear which data pattern is meant to be indicative of dynamic bias and thus to be captured by these indices. Moreover, we hypothesized that the new indices are sensitive to SD differences at the response time (RT) level in the absence of bias. METHOD Randomly generated datasets were analyzed to assess properties of the Attention Bias Variability (ABV) and Trial Level Bias Score (TL-BS) indices. Sensitivity to creating differences in 1) RT standard deviation, 2) mean RT, and 3) bias magnitude were assessed. In addition, two possible definitions of dynamic attention bias were explored by creating differences in 4) frequency of bias switching, and 5) bias magnitude in the presence of constant switching. RESULTS ABV and TL-BS indices were found highly sensitive to increasing SD at the response time level, insensitive to increasing bias, linearly sensitive to increasing bias magnitude in the presence of bias switches, and non-linearly sensitive to increasing the frequency of bias switches. The ABV index was also found responsive to increasing mean response times in the absence of bias. CONCLUSION Recently proposed DPT derived variability indices cannot uncouple measurement error from bias variability. Significant group differences may be observed even if there is no bias present in any individual dataset. This renders the new indices in their current form unfit for empirical purposes. Our discussion focuses on fostering debate and ideas for new research to validate the potentially very important notion of biased attention being dynamic.},

We know relatively little, however, about the specific factors that contribute to this elevated risk. The present study investigated the effects of familial risk for depression and the 5-HTTLPR and COMT Val158Met polymorphisms, which have been associated with risk for depression, on biases in endorsement of and memory for positive and negative adjectives. Methods Following a negative mood induction, 60 girls between the ages of 10 and 14 who had recurrent depressed mothers (high risk for depression) and 91 age-matched daughters of never-disordered mothers (low risk for depression) completed a Self-Referent Encoding Task in which they decided whether negative and positive adjectives described them. Following the task they were asked to recall as many of the adjectives as they could. Results Despite the absence of significant group differences in endorsement of positive or negative adjectives, high-risk girls with the COMT Val158Met Val/Val polymorphism recalled more positive (but not negative) words that they had endorsed than did high-risk girls who were homozygous for the Met allele. COMT was not associated with recall of valenced adjectives in low-risk girls. Across risk groups, 5-HTTLPR polymorphism was not associated with recall of valenced adjectives. Limitations Even with over 150 participants, there were relatively small numbers in some of the cells of this study, limiting its statistical power. Conclusions These results suggest that assessing the interaction of familial risk status and COMT polymorphism is important in understanding the development of depressive disorders. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

The present review examines methodologies suited to identify such symptom networks and discusses network analysis techniques that may be used to extract clinically and scientifically useful information from such networks (e.g., which symptom is most central in a person's network). The authors also show how network analysis techniques may be used to construct simulation models that mimic symptom dynamics. Network approaches naturally explain the limited success of traditional research strategies, which are typically based on the idea that symptoms are manifestations of some common underlying factor, while offering promising methodological alternatives.

A wide variety of matrices that are used in statistics can be represented in this fashion, for example matrices that contain (implied) covariances, factor loadings, regression parameters and p values. qgraph can also be used as a psychometric tool, as it performs exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, using sem and lavaan; the output of these packages is automatically visualized in qgraph, which may aid the interpretation of results.

Yet a radically different approach to conceptualizing psychopathology promises to advance our understanding, thereby complementing traditional laboratory experiments. In contrast to viewing symptoms as reflective of underlying, latent categories or dimensions, network analysis conceptualizes symptoms as constitutive of mental disorders, not reflective of them. Disorders emerge from the causal interactions among symptoms themselves, and intervening on central symptoms in disorder networks promises to foster rapid recovery. One purpose of this article is to contrast network analysis with traditional approaches, and consider its strengths and limitations. A second purpose is to review novel computational methods that may enable researchers to discern the causal structure of disorders (e.g., Bayesian networks).

	abstract = {Gaussian graphical models with sparsity in the inverse covariance matrix are of significant interest in many modern applications. For the problem of recovering the graphical structure, information criteria provide useful optimization objectives for algorithms searching through sets of graphs or for selection of tuning parameters of other methods such as the graphical lasso, which is a likelihood penalization technique. In this paper we establish the consistency of an extended Bayesian information criterion for Gaussian graphical models in a scenario where both the number of variables p and the sample size n grow. Compared to earlier work on the regression case, our treatment allows for growth in the number of non-zero parameters in the true model, which is necessary in order to cover connected graphs. We demonstrate the performance of this criterion on simulated data when used in conjunction with the graphical lasso, and verify that the criterion indeed performs better than either cross-validation or the ordinary Bayesian information criterion when p and the number of non-zero parameters q both scale with n.},

This technique is one of the most widely known methods for choosing a regularization parameter in (deterministic) inverse problems, but has only rarely been applied in statistics. The most important execptions originate in Statistical Learning Theory and the so-called Data Approximation approach. We unify and extend previous results on kernel density estimation with bandwidths chosen by the discrepancy principle and derive analogous results for regular histograms. We also show that for certain densities with infinite peaks using the discrepancy principle leads inconsistent estimators. Furthermore, we compare the discrepancy principle to standard methods in a simulation study. The results show that some versions of the discrepancy principle are competetive, and that the behaviour of the methods for samples of size at least up to n=2500 can be quite different from their asymptotic behaviour.},

	abstract = {Most research on sensitive periods has focussed on early sensory, motor, and language development, but it has recently been suggested that adolescence might represent a second 'window of opportunity' in brain development. Here, we explore three candidate areas of development that are proposed to undergo sensitive periods in adolescence: memory, the effects of social stress, and drug use. We describe rodent studies, neuroimaging, and large-scale behavioural studies in humans that have yielded data that are consistent with heightened neuroplasticity in adolescence. Critically however, concrete evidence for sensitive periods in adolescence is mostly lacking. To provide conclusive evidence, experimental studies are needed that directly manipulate environmental input and compare effects in child, adolescent, and adult groups. Recently the idea that adolescence may be a sensitive period of development has gained traction in the literature.Adolescence is characterised by changes in brain structure and function, particularly in regions of the cortex that are involved in higher-level cognitive processes such as memory, for which capacity may be heightened in adolescence.Heightened plasticity may not only result in increased opportunities for development but also in increased vulnerabilities. Data from rodents show effects of social isolation and reduced fear extinction that are consistent with adolescence as a sensitive period for the development of mental illness.Adolescent sensitive periods are likely to be characterised by large individual differences. Rodent data indicate that individuals who are exposed to drugs such as cannabis during adolescence may experience detrimental effects on cognitive functioning.},

The articles in this special section amply demonstrate the value of the I-P paradigm as a heuristic framework for conceptualizing and studying the role(s) of cognitive factors in the etiology and maintenance of child and adolescent psychopathology. However the current status of such research also reflects a number of limitations that warrant consideration if the potential value of the I-P paradigm is to be fully realized. Specifically, understanding the role(s) played by such factors is impeded by a variety of insufficiently addressed methodological and psychometric issues, as well as by insufficiently articulated theories regarding such factors. These issues are particularly challenging for child and adolescent psychopathology researchers because of the complexities added by development. The value of I-P theories of childhood and adolescent psychopathology will be considerably enhanced if these issues are more fully considered in future research.},

	abstract = {Depression is one of the most common mental health problems in childhood and adolescence. Although data consistently show it is associated with self-reported negative cognitive styles, less is known about the mechanisms underlying this relationship. Cognitive biases in attention, interpretation and memory represent plausible mechanisms and are known to characterise adult depression. We provide the first structured review of studies investigating the nature and causal role of cognitive biases in youth depression. Key questions are (i) do cognitive biases characterise youth depression? (ii) are cognitive biases a vulnerability factor for youth depression? and (iii) do cognitive biases play a causal role in youth depression? We find consistent evidence for positive associations between attention and interpretation biases and youth depression. Stronger biases in youth with an elevated risk of depression support cognitive-vulnerability models. Preliminary evidence from cognitive bias modification paradigms supports a causal role of attention and interpretation biases in youth depression but these paradigms require testing in clinical samples before they can be considered treatment tools. Studies of memory biases in youth samples have produced mixed findings and none have investigated the causal role of memory bias. We identify numerous areas for future research in this emerging field.},

	abstract = {Most research on sensitive periods has focussed on early sensory, motor, and language development, but it has recently been suggested that adolescence might represent a second 'window of opportunity' in brain development. Here, we explore three candidate areas of development that are proposed to undergo sensitive periods in adolescence: memory, the effects of social stress, and drug use. We describe rodent studies, neuroimaging, and large-scale behavioural studies in humans that have yielded data that are consistent with heightened neuroplasticity in adolescence. Critically however, concrete evidence for sensitive periods in adolescence is mostly lacking. To provide conclusive evidence, experimental studies are needed that directly manipulate environmental input and compare effects in child, adolescent, and adult groups. Recently the idea that adolescence may be a sensitive period of development has gained traction in the literature.Adolescence is characterised by changes in brain structure and function, particularly in regions of the cortex that are involved in higher-level cognitive processes such as memory, for which capacity may be heightened in adolescence.Heightened plasticity may not only result in increased opportunities for development but also in increased vulnerabilities. Data from rodents show effects of social isolation and reduced fear extinction that are consistent with adolescence as a sensitive period for the development of mental illness.Adolescent sensitive periods are likely to be characterised by large individual differences. Rodent data indicate that individuals who are exposed to drugs such as cannabis during adolescence may experience detrimental effects on cognitive functioning.},

Similar effects were found whether participants generated the meanings themselves, or verified a particular meaning of the homograph. Finally, comparison with a baseline condition confirmed that systematic exposure to threatening--but not non-threatening--resolutions of ambiguous words led to generally faster access times for congruent meanings, thus resembling the interpretative bias seen in anxiety states.},

At a single assessment, 26 youths diagnosed with primary separation anxiety, social phobia, or generalized anxiety disorder completed performance-based assessments of interpretation and attention. Youths and parents also completed diagnostic interviews and youths completed a measure of negative self-statements. Components of interpretation (threat-valence judgments and speed of responding) were examined, and interpretation was explored as a correlate of youth anxiety, attention bias, and negative self-statements. Results found percentage of negative interpretations endorsed as the strongest predictor of anxiety symptoms; this index was also correlated with attention bias. Slower rejection of benign interpretations was also associated with youth-reported negative self-statements. This initial investigation provides support for a relationship between interpretation bias and anxiety and preliminary evidence for a relationship between attention and interpretation biases. Continued research dismantling the stages of basic cognition within the chain of information processing may provide a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying anxiety disorders in youths and lead to continued development and refinement of cognitive interventions. ¬© 2014.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Structural models of emotional disorders propose that anxiety disorders can be classified into fear and distress disorders. Sources of evidence for this distinction come from genetic, self-report and neurophysiological data from adults. The present study examined whether this distinction relates to cognitive processes, indexed by attention bias towards threat, which is thought to cause and maintain anxiety disorders. METHOD: Diagnostic and attention bias data were analysed from 435 children between 5 and 13 years of age; 158 had principal fear disorder (specific phobia, social phobia or separation anxiety disorder), 75 had principal distress disorder (generalized anxiety disorder, GAD) and 202 had no psychiatric disorder. Anxious children were a clinic-based treatment-seeking sample. Attention bias was assessed on a visual-probe task with angry, neutral and happy faces. RESULTS: Compared to healthy controls, children with principal distress disorder (GAD) showed a significant bias towards threat relative to neutral faces whereas children with principal fear disorder showed an attention bias away from threat relative to neutral faces. Overall, children displayed an attention bias towards happy faces, irrespective of diagnostic group. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the distinction between fear and distress disorders, and extend empirically derived structural models of emotional disorders to threat processing in childhood, when many anxiety disorders begin and predict lifetime impairment.},

	abstract = {Anxiety disorders in children and adolescents are common and impairing. As many patients do not benefit from - or have difficulties accessing - frontline treatments, novel, effective and easy-to-deliver interventions are needed. Cognitive Bias Modification of Interpretations (CBM-I) training has been used to treat adult anxiety disorders. CBM-I methods train individuals to endorse benign rather than negative resolutions of ambiguous cues. Developmental extensions of CBM-I are important for several reasons. First, implementing CBM-I in symptomatic children and adolescents may facilitate early preventative gains. Second, as training uses simple learning mechanisms, CBM-I may reflect a developmentally-suitable strategy for shaping adaptive processing styles. Third, as this age range involves protracted neurocognitive maturation and associated plasticity, administering CBM-I early could drive powerful, long-lasting benefits for emotional development. Finally, data from CBM-I studies could inform the cognitive mechanisms involved in the genesis of early-emerging anxiety. This paper provides the first organised review of CBM-I studies conducted in children and adolescents, and contains suggestions for future research that may help realise the therapeutic potential of early CBM-I interventions. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-Œ±-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ‚â§ 2.0 √Ö for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

	abstract = {? 2016 The Australian Psychological SocietyObjective: Heightened trait anxiety is associated with impaired behavioural preparedness for natural hazards. However, little is known about the mechanisms that contribute to this association. Research has shown that trait anxiety is associated with an attentional bias (AB) towards threat-relevant information, and some researchers have suggested that such vigilance could exacerbate the detrimental effect of trait anxiety on behavioural preparedness. Conversely, given the potentially adaptive role of AB in promoting engagement in danger mitigation behaviour, it is also possible that AB could ameliorate the negative association between anxiety and preparedness. The aim of this study was to discriminate the validity of these two hypotheses. Method: Participants were recruited from a bushfire-prone community in Western Australia and were assessed on measures of trait anxiety, AB to threat, and current bushfire preparedness. Results: As predicted, the results showed a negative correlation between trait anxiety and bushfire preparedness, and a positive correlation between trait anxiety and AB to bushfire-related threat. Furthermore, the negative relationship between trait anxiety and preparedness was moderated by this AB to bushfire-related threat, with the direction of this moderation showing that AB further exacerbated this negative relationship. Conclusions: This study is the first to show that in a situation where people are exposed to a real-world danger that can be mitigated through appropriate engagement in specific preparatory behaviours, AB to danger-relevant threat serves to strengthen the observed negative association between trait anxiety and behavioural preparedness. Implications of these findings are discussed.},

	abstract = {Prominent cognitive theories postulate that an attentional bias toward threatening information contributes to the etiology, maintenance, or exacerbation of fear and anxiety. In this review, we investigate to what extent these causal claims are supported by sound empirical evidence. Although differences in attentional bias are associated with differences in fear and anxiety, this association does not emerge consistently. Moreover, there is only limited evidence that individual differences in attentional bias are related to individual differences in fear or anxiety. In line with a causal relation, some studies show that attentional bias precedes fear or anxiety in time. However, other studies show that fear and anxiety can precede the onset of attentional bias, suggesting circular or reciprocal causality. Importantly, a recent line of experimental research shows that changes in attentional bias can lead to changes in anxiety. Yet changes in fear and anxiety also lead to changes in attentional bias, which confirms that the relation between attentional bias and fear and anxiety is unlikely to be unidirectional. Finally, a similar causal relation between interpretation bias and anxiety has been documented. In sum, there is evidence in favor of causality, yet a strict unidirectional cause-effect model is unlikely to hold. The relation between attentional bias and fear and anxiety is best described as a bidirectional, maintaining, or mutually reinforcing relation.

Results showed that high trait anxious participants exhibited a larger attentional bias to threat than low trait anxious participants, and importantly, this anxiety-linked attentional bias did not differ as a function of danger mitigability.

	abstract = {Risk assessment is a pattern of activities involved in detection and analysis of threat stimuli and the situations in which the threat is encountered. It is a core process in the choice of specific defenses, such as flight, freezing, defensive threat and defensive attack, that counter the threat and minimize the danger it poses. This highly adaptive process takes into account important characteristics, such as type and location (including distance from the subject) of the threat, as well as those (e.g. presence of an escape route or hiding place) of the situation, combining them to predict which specific defense is optimal with that particular combination of threat and situation. Risk assessment is particularly associated with ambiguity either of the threat stimulus or of the outcome of available defensive behaviors. It is also crucial in determining that threat is no longer present, permitting a return to normal, nondefensive behavior. Although risk assessment has been described in detail in rodents, it is also a feature of human defensive behavior, particularly in association with ambiguity. Rumination may be a specifically human form of risk assessment, more often expressed by women, and highly associated with anxiety.Risk assessment behaviors respond to drugs effective against generalized anxiety disorder; however, flight, a dominant specific defense in many common situations, shows a pharmacological response profile closer to that of panic disorder. Risk assessment and flight also appear to show some consistent differences in terms of brain regional activation patterns, suggesting a potential biological differentiation of anxiety and fear/panic systems. An especially intriguing possibility is that mirror neurons may respond to some of the same types of situational differences that are analyzed during risk assessment, suggesting an additional functional role for these neurons. ¬© 2010.},

The current paper draws on theoretical frameworks and key empirical studies to outline the distinctive attentional processes highlighted as being important in understanding anxiety. We develop a conceptual framework to make a distinction between two attentional biases: selective attention to threat and hypervigilance for threat. We suggest that these biases each have a different purpose and can account for the typical patterns of facilitated and impaired attention evident in anxious individuals. The framework is novel in its specification of the eye movement behavior associated with these attentional biases. We highlight that selective attention involves narrowing overt attention onto threat to ensure that these stimuli receive processing priority, leading to rapid engagement with task-relevant threat and delayed disengagement from task-irrelevant threat. We show that hypervigilance operates in the presence and absence of threat and involves monitoring for potential dangers via attentional broadening or excessive scanning of the environment with numerous eye movements, leading to improved threat detection and increased distraction from task-irrelevant threat. We conclude that future research could usefully employ eye movement measures to more clearly understand the diverse roles of attention in anxiety. ¬© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Anxiety disorders increase risk for the early development of several diseases of aging. Elevated inflammation, a common risk factor across diseases of aging, may play a key role in the relationship between anxiety and physical disease. However, the neurobiological mechanisms linking anxiety with elevated inflammation remain unclear. In this review, we present a neurobiological model of the mechanisms by which anxiety promotes inflammation. Specifically we propose that exaggerated neurobiological sensitivity to threat in anxious individuals may lead to sustained threat perception, which is accompanied by prolonged activation of threat-related neural circuitry and threat-responsive biological systems including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, autonomic nervous system (ANS), and inflammatory response. Over time, this pattern of responding can promote chronic inflammation through structural and functional brain changes, altered sensitivity of immune cell receptors, dysregulation of the HPA axis and ANS, and accelerated cellular aging. Chronic inflammation, in turn, increases risk for diseases of aging. Exaggerated neurobiological sensitivity to threat may thus be a treatment target for reducing disease risk in anxious individuals. ¬© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Following conditioning, participants had to search for a target; while on some trials, either an irrelevant CS+ or CS- stimulus was present. The results show that the presence of an irrelevant distractor that was previously associated with fear slowed a search more than a distractor without fear association.

We therefore investigated individuals with diagnosed generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), healthy volunteers, and individuals with high trait anxiety (but not meeting GAD diagnostic criteria). Across two experiments we found faster disengagement from negative (angry and fearful) faces in GAD groups, an effect opposite to that expected on the basis of the subclinical literature. Together these data challenge current assumptions that we can generalize, to those with GAD, the pattern of selective attentional orienting to threat found in subclinical groups.

Attention and interpretation biases were significantly correlated with anxiety. Mixed results were reported with regard to depression: evidence was found for an interpretation bias, and for an attention bias as measured with the EVST but not with the DPT. Furthermore, interpretation and attention biases predicted unique variance in anxiety and depression scores.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: According to the CONSORT statement, significance testing of baseline differences in randomized controlled trials should not be performed. In fact, this practice has been discouraged by numerous authors throughout the last forty years. During that time span, reporting of baseline differences has substantially decreased in the leading general medical journals. Our own experience in the field of nutrition behavior research however, is that co-authors, reviewers and even editors are still very persistent in their demand for these tests. The aim of this paper is therefore to negate this demand by providing clear evidence as to why testing for baseline differences between intervention groups statistically is superfluous and why such results should not be published.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nDISCUSSION: Testing for baseline differences is often propagated because of the belief that it shows whether randomization was successful and it identifies real or important differences between treatment arms that should be accounted for in the statistical analyses. Especially the latter argument is flawed, because it ignores the fact that the prognostic strength of a variable is also important when the interest is in adjustment for confounding. In addition, including prognostic variables as covariates can increase the precision of the effect estimate. This means that choosing covariates based on significance tests for baseline differences might lead to omissions of important covariates and, less importantly, to inclusion of irrelevant covariates in the analysis. We used data from four supermarket trials on the effects of pricing strategies on fruit and vegetables purchases, to show that results from fully adjusted analyses sometimes do appreciably differ from results from analyses adjusted for significant baseline differences only. We propose to adjust for known or anticipated important prognostic variables. These could or should be pre-specified in trial protocols. Subsequently, authors should report results from the fully adjusted as well as crude analyses, especially for dichotomous and time to event data. Based on our arguments, which were illustrated by our findings, we propose that journals in and outside the field of nutrition behavior actively adopt the CONSORT 2010 statement on this topic by not publishing significance tests for baseline differences anymore.},

Bayesian analysis can address many of these limitations, however, this approach has been underutilized largely due to a dearth of accessible software options. JASP is a new open-source statistical package that facilitates both Bayesian and NHST analysis using a graphical interface. The aim of this article is to provide an applied introduction to Bayesian inference using JASP. First, we will provide a brief background outlining the benefits of Bayesian inference. We will then use JASP to demonstrate Bayesian alternatives for several common null hypothesis significance tests. While Bayesian analysis is by no means a new method, this type of statistical inference has been largely inaccessible for most psychiatry researchers. JASP provides a straightforward means of performing Bayesian analysis using a graphical " point and click " environment that will be familiar to researchers conversant with other graphical statistical packages, such as SPSS.},

We explain empirical comorbidity patterns based on a network model of psychiatric symptoms, derived from an analysis of symptom overlap in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We show that a) half of the symptoms in the DSM-IV network are connected, b) the architecture of these connections conforms to a small world structure, featuring a high degree of clustering but a short average path length, and c) distances between disorders in this structure predict empirical comorbidity rates. Network simulations of Major Depressive Episode and Generalized Anxiety Disorder show that the model faithfully reproduces empirical population statistics for these disorders. CONCLUSIONS: In the network model, mental disorders are inherently complex. This explains the limited successes of genetic, neuroscientific, and etiological approaches to unravel their causes. We outline a psychosystems approach to investigate the structure and dynamics of mental disorders.},

Prevention programs have been directed at broad, nonspecific anxiety and at more specific anxiety types, such as panic disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. Prevention of anxiety is still a relatively new field, but there has been a recent surge of literature reporting on different prevention programs. Universal prevention trials have shown modest but promising results, and school-based programs offered to all students also help to reduce stigmatization and common barriers to accessing treatment (eg, time, location, and cost). In contrast, targeted programs tend to show somewhat larger effects but rely on identification of relevant populations. Specific programs for the prevention of panic disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder have also demonstrated some preliminary success. This paper reviews the recent studies of prevention of anxiety and discusses several key issues, specifically (1) identification of at-risk participants for prevention programs, (2) motivation for participation, (3) optimal age for intervention, and (4) who should deliver the program.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many changes in social behavior take place during adolescence. Sexuality and romantic interests emerge during this time, and adolescents spend more time with peers and less time with parents and family. While such changes in social behavior have been well documented in the literature, relatively few neurophysiological explanations for these behavioral changes have been presented. METHOD: In this article we selectively review studies documenting (a) the neuronal circuits that are dedicated to the processing of social information; (b) the changes in social behavior that take place during adolescence; (c) developmental alterations in the adolescent brain; and (d) links between the emergence of mood and anxiety disorders in adolescence and changes in brain physiology occurring at that time. RESULTS: The convergence of evidence from this review indicates a relationship between development of brain physiology and developmental changes in social behavior. Specifically, the surge of gonadal steroids at puberty induces changes within the limbic system that alters the emotional attributions applied to social stimuli while the gradual maturation of the prefrontal cortex enables increasingly complex and controlled responses to social information. CONCLUSIONS: Observed alterations in adolescent social behavior reflect developmental changes in the brain social information processing network. We further speculate that dysregulation of the social information processing network in this critical period may contribute to the onset of mood and anxiety disorders during adolescence.},

We trace the differences between Forbes et al.‚Äôs (2017) results and our own to the fact that they did not appear to accurately implement all network models, and used debatable metrics to assess replicability. In particular, Forbes et al.

Additional meta-analytic reviews examined the efficacy of CBT for various problems in children and elderly adults. The strongest support exists for CBT of anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, bulimia, anger control problems, and general stress. Eleven studies compared response rates between CBT and other treatments or control conditions. CBT showed higher response rates than the comparison conditions in 7 of these reviews and only one review reported that CBT had lower response rates than comparison treatments. In general, the evidence-base of CBT is very strong. However, additional research is needed to examine the efficacy of CBT for randomized-controlled studies. Moreover, except for children and elderly populations, no meta-analytic studies of CBT have been reported on specific subgroups, such as ethnic minorities and low income samples.},

Reliabilities of scores for experimental tasks are likely to differ from one study to another to the extent that the task stimuli change, the number of trials varies, the type of individuals taking the task changes, the administration conditions are altered, or the focal task variable differs. Given that reliabilities vary as a function of the design of these tasks and the characteristics of the individuals taking them, making inferences about the reliability of scores in an ongoing study based on reliability estimates from prior studies is precarious. Thus, it would be advantageous to estimate reliability based on data from the ongoing study. We argue that internal consistency estimates of reliability are underutilized for experimental task data and in many applications could provide this information using a single administration of a task. We discuss different methods for computing internal consistency estimates with a generalized coefficient alpha and the conditions under which these estimates are accurate. We illustrate use of these coefficients using data for three different tasks.},

It remains unclear whether those with GAD experience more dysregulated emotions during periods of euthymia and positive affect or whether these deficits occur only during periods of worry. Individuals with GAD (with and without co-occurring dysphoria) and non-anxious controls were randomly assigned to receive a worry, neutral, or relaxation induction. Following the induction, all participants viewed a film clip documented to elicit sadness. Intensity of emotions and emotion regulation were examined following the induction period and film clip. The results revealed that, regardless of co-occurring dysphoria, individuals with GAD in the worry condition experienced more intense depressed affect than GAD participants in the other conditions and controls participants. In contrast, presence of worry appeared to have less impact on indices of emotion dysregulation, which were greater in participants with GAD compared to controls, but largely insensitive to contextual effects of worry or of relaxation. Following film viewing, both GAD participants with and without dysphoria displayed poorer understanding, acceptance, and management of emotions than did controls. However, acceptance and management deficits were most pronounced in individuals with both GAD and co-occurring dysphoria. Implications for the role of emotions in conceptualization and treatment of GAD are discussed. ¬© 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The proposed fear appeal theory, called the Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM), expands on previous approaches in three ways: (a) by explaining why fear appeals fail; (b) by re-incorporating fear as a central variable; and (c) by specifying the relationship between threat and efficacy in propositional forms.

First, we demonstrate the importance of variability in task scores, which in turn directly impacts reliability, particularly when comparing correlations in different populations. Second, we demonstrate the importance of variability and reliability for evaluating potential failures to replicate predicted correlations, even within the same population. Third, we demonstrate how researchers can turn to evaluating psychometric properties as a way of evaluating the feasibility of utilizing the task in new settings (e.g., online administration). Lastly, we show how the examination of psychometric properties can help researchers make informed decisions when designing a study, such as determining the appropriate number of trials for a task.},

	title = {Bayes {Factors} for {Research} {Workers}},
	abstract = {In this dissertation we advocate the use of Bayes factors in empirical research to replace or complement standard null hypothesis tests based on p-values. These Bayes factors were specifically designed to quantify the evidence for or against the existence of an effect. This was done by comparing two models with the same distributional assumptions, where the alternative model is an extension of the null model by incorporating one extra parameter. Instead of returning a decision to ‚Äúreject‚Äù or ‚Äúnot reject‚Äù, a Bayes factor BF10(d) returns a non-negative number that represents the evidence provided by the observed data d for the model that includes the effect. The returned number can be seen as a refinement of the binary decision with BF10(d) = the null, respectively. Moreover, the Bayes factor allows its users to forgo the binary ‚àû and BF10(d) = 0 corresponding to definite rejection and acceptance of decision and acknowledge uncertainty, so that the evidence can be updated continually in light of new data, directly and easily. For empirical scientists to be able to use these Bayes factors, we implemented them in Jeffreys‚Äôs Amazing Statistics Program, JASP, which is freely available and open-source. (url:},

Yet we are all inconsistent in our actions within a day, or from, one day to the next, and much of such inconsistency is of positive value for our survival and development.

The goal of the present study was to examine the efficacy of a programme intended to train attention towards positive cues and a programme intended to train attention towards negative cues. In a randomised, controlled, double-blind design, the impact of these two training conditions on both selective attention and social anxiety were compared to that of a control training condition. A modified dot probe task was used, and delivered via the internet. A total of 129 individuals, diagnosed with SAD, were randomly assigned to one of these three conditions and took part in a 14-day programme with daily training/control sessions. Participants in all three groups did not on average display an attentional bias prior to the training. Critically, results on change in attention bias implied that significantly differential change in selective attention to threat was not detected in the three conditions. However, symptoms of social anxiety reduced significantly from pre- to follow-up-assessment in all three conditions (dwithin = 0.63-1.24), with the procedure intended to train attention towards threat cues producing, relative to the control condition, a significantly greater reduction of social fears. There were no significant differences in social anxiety outcome between the training condition intended to induce attentional bias towards positive cues and the control condition. To our knowledge, this is the first RCT where a condition intended to induce attention bias to negative cues yielded greater emotional benefits than a control condition. Intriguingly, changes in symptoms are unlikely to be by the mechanism of change in attention processes since there was no change detected in bias per se. Implications of this finding for future research on attention bias modification in social anxiety are discussed. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01463137.},

	abstract = {Objective Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is a widely used reliability index in test-retest, intrarater, and interrater reliability analyses. This article introduces the basic concept of ICC in the content of reliability analysis. Discussion for Researchers There are 10 forms of ICCs. Because each form involves distinct assumptions in their calculation and will lead to different interpretations, researchers should explicitly specify the ICC form they used in their calculation. A thorough review of the research design is needed in selecting the appropriate form of ICC to evaluate reliability. The best practice of reporting ICC should include software information, ‚Äúmodel,‚Äù ‚Äútype,‚Äù and ‚Äúdefinition‚Äù selections. Discussion for Readers When coming across an article that includes ICC, readers should first check whether information about the ICC form has been reported and if an appropriate ICC form was used. Based on the 95\% confident interval of the ICC estimate, values less than 0.5, between 0.5 and 0.75, between 0.75 and 0.9, and greater than 0.90 are indicative of poor, moderate, good, and excellent reliability, respectively. Conclusion This article provides a practical guideline for clinical researchers to choose the correct form of ICC and suggests the best practice of reporting ICC parameters in scientific publications. This article also gives readers an appreciation for what to look for when coming across ICC while reading an article.},

	abstract = {Each time a latency in responding to a stimulus is mea-sured, we owe a debt to F. C. Donders, who in the mid-19th century made the fundamental discovery that the time required to perform a mental computation reveals something fundamental about how the mind works. Donders expressed the idea in the following simple and optimistic statement about the feasibility of measuring the mind: " Will all quantitative treatment of mental processes be out of the question then? By no means! An important factor seemed to be sus-ceptible to measurement: I refer to the time required for simple men-tal processes " (Donders, 1868/1969, pp. 413‚Äì414). With particular variations of simple stimuli and subjects' choices, Donders demonstrated that it is possible to bring order to under-standing invisible thought processes by computing the time that elapses between stimulus presentation and response production. A more specific observation he offered lies at the center of our own modern understanding of mental operations: We made the subjects respond with the right hand to the stimulus on the right side, and with the left hand to the stimulus on the left side. . . . When movement of the right hand was required with stim-ulation on the left side or the other way round, then the time lapse was longer and errors common. (Donders, 1868/1969, p. 421) With this modest test Donders opened up possibilities for study-ing mental processes, the effects of which are visible in behavioral and brain science even 150 years later. The idea underlying an entire family of response latency techniques remains the same as conjec-tured and tested by Donders: the easier a mental task, the quicker the decision point is reached and the fewer the errors that result. To make the right‚Äìright and left‚Äìleft association is easier than the right‚Äì left and left‚Äìright association, and the difference in speed between the two tasks can serve as an indicator of their relative difficulty. With a psychology that relied on introspective access not yet born, Donders took for granted the logic underlying such a method‚Äîthat mental states could be inferred on the basis of objective patterns of responses rather than relying on asking the subject the question, " Which of these two tasks is easier? " Time as the variable to estimate the nature of mental computa-tion underlies dozens of methods: the Stroop task, episodic or repeti-tion priming, semantic priming, evaluation priming, and many others to assess attention, perception, memory and categorization. We focus on one such measure, the Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald, McGhee, \& Schwartz, 1998), which provides an estimate of the strength of association between concepts and attributes, much like the semantic priming measure does (see Wittenbrink, Chapter 2, this volume). In a grant proposal submitted by Banaji and Greenwald on January 13, 1994, the logic underlying the IAT was described as fol-lows:},

An important impediment to the widespread adoption of Bayesian tests is arguably the lack of user-friendly software for the run-of-the-mill statistical problems that confront psychologists for the analysis of almost every experiment: the t-test, ANOVA, correlation, regression, and contingency tables. In Part II of this series we introduce JASP (http://www.jasp-stats.org), an open-source, cross-platform, user-friendly graphical software package that allows users to carry out Bayesian hypothesis tests for standard statistical problems.

This study explored whether facial interpretation bias modification (FIBM), a similar paradigm designed to shift emotional interpretation (and/or perception) of faces would transfer to: (i) self-reported symptoms and (ii) a battery of cognitive tasks. In a preregistered, double-blind randomized controlled trial, healthy participants received eight online sessions of FIBM ( N ‚Äâ=‚Äâ52) or eight sham sessions ( N ‚Äâ=‚Äâ52). While we replicate that FIBM successfully shifts ambiguous facial expression interpretation in the intervention group, this failed to transfer to the majority of self-report or cognitive measures. There was, however, weak, inconclusive evidence of transfer to a self-report measure of stress, a cognitive measure of anhedonia, and evidence that results were moderated by trait anxiety (whereby transference was greatest in those with higher baseline symptoms). We discuss the need for work in both larger and clinical samples, while urging caution that these FIBM training effects may not transfer to clinically relevant domains.},

Considering the causal role of this interpretive bias in anxiety, it was recently established that modifying interpretive biases influences anxiety. This suggests that anxiety can be clinically treated by directly targeting this interpretive bias. The present study was designed to modify a negative interpretive bias in highly anxious individuals, and subsequently assess the hypothesized beneficial effects on clinical measures. High trait-anxious participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: a positive interpretational Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM-I) or a control condition (n = 2 ?? 17). The program was offered online for eight consecutive days. Upon completing the program, participants who had followed positive CBM-I were less state and trait-anxious compared to the control group. Additionally, positively trained participants scored lower on a measure of general psychopathology (SCL-90). No effects were observed on social anxiety and stress vulnerability. The mixed pattern of findings renders them rather inconclusive, leaving interpretations of the potential therapeutic merits of CBM-I open for future research. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Anxiety disorders are globally prevalent, debilitating and onset in early life. Cognitive bias modification of interpretations (CBM-I) training has emerged as a targeted intervention for early emerging anxiety problems. While CBM-I can alter interpretational styles in unselected and clinical-analogue samples of adolescents, no studies have assessed its capacity to change biases in clinical samples. Here, we assessed training efficacy in ameliorating interpretation biases and anxious mood in adolescents with anxiety disorders. Twenty-eight Chinese adolescents meeting criteria for a current anxiety disorder were randomly assigned to receive positive or neutral CBM-I training. Training involved completing a word-fragment to resolve the outcomes of sixty ambiguous scenarios. During positive training, scenarios ended with benign/positive resolutions, but during neutral training, half of the scenarios were resolved positively and half negatively. Positively trained patients interpreted new ambiguous scenarios less negatively than the neutral training group although training effects were not observed on a questionnaire measure of interpretation bias. Training effects on mood were also absent. Before the clinical implications of CBM-I can be considered in adolescents, research needs to establish optimal training parameters for symptom-changes to occur. ¬© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, findings also indicate that, all told, very few researchers are assessing and reporting on internal score validity, and score precision/reliability, and external score validity, and in that sequence, suggesting that applied researchers may not always be adopting sound test-evaluative rationales in their psychometric assessments.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-Œ±-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ‚â§ 2.0 √Ö for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Controversies about how reliability is related to statistical power often can be explained by authors‚Äô use of the term ‚Äúreliability‚Äù in a general way to mean ‚Äúconsistency,‚Äù ‚Äúprecision,‚Äù or ‚Äúdependability,‚Äù which does not always correspond to its mathematical definition as a variance ratio. The present note shows how adherence to the mathematical definition can help resolve the issue and presents some derivations and illustrative examples that have further implications for significance testing and practical research.},

	abstract = {Forbes, Wright, Markon, and Krueger (2017) make a compelling case for proceeding cautiously with respect to the overinterpretation and dissemination of results using the increasingly popular approach of creating " networks " from co-occurrences of psychopathology symptoms. We commend the authors on their initial investigation and their utilization of cross-validation techniques in an effort to capture the stability of a variety of network estimation methods. Such techniques get at the heart of establishing " reproducibility, " an increasing focus of concern in both psychology (e.g., Pashler \& Wagenmakers, 2012) and science more generally (e.g., Baker, 2016). However, as we will show, the problem is likely worse (or at least more complicated) than they initially indicated. Specifically, for multivariate binary data, the marginal distributions enforce a large degree of structure on the data. We show that some expected measurements‚Äîsuch as commonly used centrality statistics‚Äî can have substantially higher values than what would usually be expected. As such, we propose a nonparametric approach to generate confidence intervals through Monte Carlo simulation. We apply the proposed methodology to the National Comorbidity Survey ‚Äì Replication, provided by Forbes et al., finding that the many of the results are indistinguishable from what would be expected by chance. Further, we discuss the problem of multiple testing and potential issues of applying methods developed for 1-mode networks (e.g., ties within a single set of observations) to 2-mode networks (e.g., ties between 2 distinct sets of entities). When taken together, these issues indicate that the psychometric network models should be employed with extreme caution and interpreted guardedly. General Scientific Summary We show that accounting for the base rates of criteria and controlling for the distribution of severity rates within a population can result in network models that are no different than random chance. As such, it is imperative that we validate these models with additional approaches and perspectives and not rely solely on psychometric network analytic approaches. We commend the authors‚ÄîForbes, Wright, Markon, and Krueger (2017)‚Äîfor bringing to light one of the issues that has arisen recently when attempting to make inferences about the structure of so-called psychopathology networks. 1 Specifically, Forbes et al. note that there are emerging regarding our ability to determine the extent that network structures obtained from two (or more) samples are similar or different in key respects. That is, do they replicate? Judging the similarity of various symptom network solutions can be challenging for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the number of parameters modeled including the number of edges (paths) connecting nodes (symptoms) and various measures that are derived from these, perhaps most critically, centrality measures that speak to the relative importance of indi-vidual symptoms vis a vis the total network. Depending upon the specific measures of centrality under consideration, such centrality measures could represent a powerful way to identify symptoms that are more fundamental (as opposed to accessory) to a given 1 We note that there is a good deal of appropriation of terminology from the social network analysis literature used in these analyses; we would caution too much transference as the psychopathology networks are in-duced from bipartite graphs versus being observed directly.},

	volume = {126},
	issn = {19391846},
	doi = {10.1037/abn0000313},
	abstract = {The use of zero imputation to account for the skip-structure in the structured diagnostic interviews of the two surveys biased our results. It is remarkable that Borsboom et al. chastise us for this, given they used the same process on the same data to argue for the utility of network models (Borsboom \& Cramer, 2013; Cramer, Waldorp, van der Maas, \& Borsboom, 2010). In fact, this was their methodological decision, which we emulated in an effort to mirror their methods: " We interpreted missing values that arose from the skip structure of the questionnaire as absent symptoms and replaced these by zeros, which seems a reasonable course of action, given the way the DSM‚ÄìIV is set up " (Borsboom \& Cramer, 2013, p. 104). We subsequently emulated this approach in the National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing data, as have all other network analyses of psychopathology data based on structured interviews with a skip structure that we know of (e.g., Boschloo et al., 2015; Rhemtulla et al., 2016). Zero imputation is thus a potential limitation of extant network approaches, rather than a " statistical inaccuracy " (p. 994) of our work. The methods we used to estimate the relative importance networks render these results invalid. Our goal was to test the replicability of the psychopathology networks as they are interpreted in the extant literature. Studies that include relative importance net-works routinely emphasize stronger edges with high relative impor-tance in their interpretation‚Äîparticularly with respect to purported clinical utility (e.g., Bryant et al. We therefore chose to examine the replicability of these edges as well as those of uncensored relative importance networks (i.e., with all edges esti-mated). However, Borsboom et al. (2017) point out that our censoring rule for the censored relative importance networks had the unintended effect of removing both edges in pairs with nearly identical edge weights. This point is well taken, and we are happy to accept that these particular results may not reflect the expected replicability of the extant relative importance network literature. We also note that in the analyses of Borsboom et al., the relative importance networks had better replicability‚Äîand may therefore represent a better avenue for future research‚Äîthan the putatively state-of-the-art Ising models, which are used in the majority of psychopathology network research. The assumptions underlying our methods were misguided. Borsboom et al. (2017) stress " the importance of assessing stability and replicability of network structures stands beyond doubt " (p. 990). They also emphasize their openness to evidence that network models are flawed in these regards because this would represent progress toward researchers' common goal of robust and replicable scientific knowledge. 1 However, they readily reject the results of our target article, suggesting that the design of our study was not appropriate for assessing replicability. Specifically, they suggest that it is not reason-able to expect that networks should replicate in methodologically matched samples‚Äî or even in two random halves of a single data set (pp. 25‚Äì26). This position is perplexing to us, given that generaliz-ability and replicability are both fundamental to the utility of research (e.g., why estimate psychopathology networks at all if we do not think they are able to identify meaningful relationships?). In fact, a review paper from their own group specifically recommends " cross-validation across similar samples " to investigate replicability (Fried \& Cramer, in press, p. 38). Borsboom et al. (2017) also argue that networks should not be expected to replicate across different network estimation methods (e.g., Ising models, relative importance networks, and directed acyclic graphs [DAGs]), citing the fact that they each " get at different aspects of the data " (p. 996) 2 and differ in sensitivity and specificity. However, Borsboom et al. do pro-pose that concordance between methods can be examined based on a nesting approach that tests only the edges estimated in sparser networks (e.g., DAGs) against the edges estimated in less sparse networks (e.g., Ising models). Their suggested ap-proach highlights the predictable conclusion that the edges from the sparser DAGs were replicated in the less sparse Ising models within each sample, but offers no guidance for how to interpret the other cross-method replicability results in their online materials (i.e., that only 41.3‚Äì42.5\% of the edges in the Ising models were replicated in the DAGs within and between samples and that all DAG and Ising model pairs had different nodes with the highest in strength, out strength, and closeness centrality). Their conclusion that " cross-method replication could hardly be better " certainly appears to be unwarranted (p. 993). In short, Borsboom et al. (2017) suggest that the replicability of network models cannot be tested based on the comparisons of different samples or different methods. Despite this, based on these same comparisons they conclude that networks models replicate very well across different samples and different meth-ods (when using the " right " metrics for quantifying replicabil-ity). We used the wrong metrics for quantifying replicability. Borsboom et al. (2017) state " the main problem with Forbes et al.'s assessment of replicability is that they do not use any measures that would seem of immediate relevance to any such analysis " (p. 995). It is hard to determine how they arrived at this conclusion, 3 given our metrics were specifically selected to quantify replicability of the network parameters at the level they are used and interpreted in the literature. For example, the key results from our target article are based on the research ques-tions " is edge A‚ÄîB estimated in both networks? " ; if so, " how much did the strength of this edge change from network 1 to 2? " ; and " does node A have the highest (or second, third, fourth highest, etc.) centrality in both networks? " These characteristics represent the features of psychopathology networks that corre-spond to network theory and their purported clinical utility (Borsboom, 2017; Fried et al., 2016). In contrast, " the most 1 Indeed, this goal was the ultimate motivation for writing our target article. 2 This line of argument highlights how important it is that researchers stop using these methods interchangeably as if they identify the same inferential targets (i.e., dynamic causal relationships among symptoms). Instead, it is vital to take the time to determine which method, if any, can uncover true underlying models (e.g., in simulated data with a known structure). Similarly, Borsboom et al. suggest that different centrality measures (e.g., strength, closeness, betweenness) should not be used either interchangeably or in conjunction with one another to identify the most central or influential node in a network. Importantly, both points contradict current practices as reflected in published studies and represent important new messages for researchers using psychopathology network methods. 3 As well as how they determined our indices of replicability to be " debatable " (p. 993) while labeling their own as " intuitive " (p. 990) and " powerful tools " (p. 990).},

These analyses are surprisingly complex, particularly if only two waves of data are available. It is unclear for non-biostatisticians where the complexity of this analysis lies and which statistical method is adequate. With the help of simulated longitudinal data of body mass index in children, we review statistical methods for the analysis of the association between the baseline value and subsequent change, assuming linear growth with time. Key issues in such analyses are mathematical coupling, measurement error, variability of change between individuals, and regression to the mean. Ideally, it is better to rely on multiple repeated measurements at different times and a linear random effects model is a standard approach if more than two waves of data are available. If only two waves of data are available, our simulations show that Blomqvist's method - which consists in adjusting for measurement error variance the estimated regression coefficient of observed change on baseline value - provides accurate estimates. The adequacy of the methods to assess the relationship between the baseline value and subsequent change depends on the number of data waves, the availability of information on measurement error, and the variability of change between individuals.},

Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining dot-probe-based ABMT in clinically diagnosed anxious patients were included. From 714 articles located through the search, 36 ABMT studies were identified and 11 studies met inclusion criteria (N = 589 patients).{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: ABMT was associated with greater clinician-rated reductions in anxiety symptoms relative to control training: between-groups effect (d = 0.42, P = .001, confidence interval (CI) = 0.18-0.66), contrast of within-group effects (Q = 7.25, P {\textless} .01). More patients in the treatment group no longer met formal diagnostic criteria for their anxiety disorder posttreatment relative to patients in the control condition (P {\textless} .05). Analyses of patients' self-reported anxiety were nonsignificant for the between-groups contrast (P = .35), and were at a trend level of significance for the contrast between the within-group effects (P = .06).

	abstract = {In this review of research concerning anxiety-linked attentional bias, we seek to illustrate a general principle that we contend applies across the breadth of experimental psychopathology. Specifically, we highlight how maintenance of a clear distinction between process and procedure serves to enhance the advancement of knowledge and understanding, while failure to maintain this distinction can foster confusion and misconception. We show how such clear differentiation has permitted the continuous refinement of assessment procedures, in ways that have led to growing confidence in the existence of the putative attentional bias process of interest, and also increasing understanding of its nature. In contrast, we show how a failure to consistently differentiate between process and procedure has contributed to confusion concerning whether or not attentional bias modification reliably alters anxiety vulnerability and dysfunction. As we demonstrate, such confusion can be avoided by distinguishing the process of attentional bias modification from the procedures that have been employed with the intention of evoking this target process. Such an approach reveals that procedures adopted with the intention of eliciting the attentional bias modification process do not always do so, but that successful evocation of the attentional bias modification process quite reliably alters anxiety symptomatology. We consider some of the specific implications for future research concerning attentional bias modification, while also pointing to the broader implications for experimental psychopathology research in general.},

Here, we extend prior research by reporting on temporal stability, as well as age and sex effects, for cognitive neuroscience paradigms optimized as part of the Cognitive Neuroscience Test Reliability and Clinical applications for Schizophrenia consortium. Ninety-nine outpatients with schizophrenia and 131 healthy controls performed 5 tasks assessing 4 constructs at 3 sessions. The constructs were (1) Goal maintenance (Dot Probe Expectancy [DPX] and AX continuous performance tasks [AX-CPT]); (2) Episodic memory (Relational and Item-Specific Encoding and Retrieval task [RiSE]); (3) Visual integration (Jittered Orientation Visual Integration task [JOVI]); and (4) Perceptual gain control (Contrast-Contrast Effect Task [CCE]). Patients performed worse than controls on all but the CCE, and the magnitude of these group differences was stable across sessions, with no sex differences observed. Improvements over sessions were seen for the AX-CPT, the DPX, and the JOVI though practice effects for the AX-CPT and the DPX were primarily present in older participants. For the AX-CPT and the JOVI, practice effects were larger for T1 to T2 than for T2 to T3. Age was associated with poor associative recognition on the RiSE and accuracy on the JOVI. Test-rest reliability ranged from poor for the JOVI threshold score to adequate to good for the DPX, AX-CPT, and JOVI accuracy measures, with RiSE and CCE measures in the moderate range. These results suggest that group differences in DPX, AX-CPT, RiSE, and JOVI are robust and consistent across repeated testing.},

Yet there has been little investigation of task manipulations that can experimentally modulate the use of proactive control in healthy young adults; such manipulations could be useful to better understand the workings of cognitive control mechanisms. In the current study, a series of three experiments demonstrate how individuals can be systematically biased toward and away from the utilization of proactive control, via strategy training and no-go manipulations, respectively. These results provide increased support for the DMC framework, and provide a new basis from which to examine group-based differences and neural mechanisms underlying the two control modes.},

Our analyses were also performed on a R2(t) metric that reflects results from single-trial analyses, therefore providing the first reliability analysis of ERP single-trial analyses. Results show that ERPs and R2(t) are highly reliable (cross-correlation {\textasciitilde}0.9, lag {\textasciitilde}4/6ms, intra-class correlation {\textasciitilde}0.9) but also idiosyncratic: ERPs and R2(t) are highly reproducible within subjects, who differ reliably from each other and the grand average across subjects. Consequently, grand averages, although highly reliable, can be misleading because they might not reflect the actual brain dynamic of any subjects. ¬© 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: In the current study, we investigated whether the internal reliability of the visual probe task measure of attentional bias for substance-related cues could be improved by incorporating eye-tracking methods and personalised stimuli. Method: Sixty social drinkers completed two visual probe tasks: one with a broad range of different alcohol pictures, the other containing only images of the participants' preferred drink. Attentional bias was inferred from manual reaction times to probes replacing the pictures, and from the duration of eye movement fixations towards the pictures (gaze dwell time). Results: Internal reliability was highest for personalised (versus general) alcohol stimuli, and for eye-tracking (versus manual reaction time) measures of attentional bias. The internal reliability of both reaction time (. Œ±=. .73) and gaze dwell time measures (. Œ±=. .76) of attentional bias for personalised alcohol stimuli was acceptable. Internal reliability of indices of attentional bias for general alcohol stimuli was inferior, although better for the gaze dwell time (. Œ±=. .51) compared to the reaction time measure (. Œ±=. .19). Attentional bias towards personalised stimuli was larger than bias to general stimuli, but only for the reaction time measure. There were no statistically significant associations between measures of attentional bias and alcohol consumption or craving. Conclusions: Adopting personalised stimuli and eye movement monitoring significantly improves the internal reliability of the alcohol-related visual probe task.},

Methods are taught under the assumption that a researcher already knows the research question and knows which methods will fit that question. Similarly, the real complexity of the thought processes that lead to a scientific undertaking is almost never described in published papers. In this paper, we first discuss how to get an idea that is worth researching. We describe sources of new ideas and how to foster a creative attitude by "cultivating your thoughts". Only a few of these ideas will make it into a study. Next, we describe how to sharpen and focus a research question so that a study becomes feasible and a valid test of the underlying idea. To do this, the idea needs to be "pruned". Pruning a research question means cutting away anything that is unnecessary, so that only the essence remains. This includes determining both the latent and the stated objectives, specific pruning questions, and the use of specific schemes to structure reasoning. After this, the following steps include preparation of a brief protocol, conduct of a pilot study, and writing a draft of the paper including draft tables. Then you are ready to carry out your research.},

We examined the internal reliability of the visual probe and modified Stroop tasks. Design: Secondary analysis of visual probe and modified Stroop task data collected across seven independent studies. Setting: Human laboratory study. Participants: Healthy volunteers (n=408 across seven independent studies) recruited from the general population on the basis of alcohol or tobacco use. Measurements: Visual probe and modified Stroop task measures of substance-related cognitive bias. Findings: Measures of cognitive bias for substance-related cues, as assayed by the visual probe and the modified Stroop tasks, may not be reliable. In particular, the visual probe task showed poor internal reliability, as did unblocked versions of the modified Stroop task. Conclusions: The modified Stroop task is preferable to the visual probe task as a measure of substance-related cognitive bias, on the basis of its psychometric properties. Studies using cognitive bias tasks should not assume they are reliable, and should routinely report reliability estimates where possible. ¬© 2011.},

	abstract = {Response to stress is a key factor in mood and anxiety disorder aetiology. Current measures of stress-response are limited because they largely rely on retrospective self-report. Objectively quantifying individual differences in stress response would be a valuable step towards improving our understanding of disorder vulnerability. Our goal is to develop a reliable, objective, within-subject probe of stress response. To this end, we examined stress-potentiated performance on an inhibitory control task from baseline to 2-4 weeks (n=50) and again after 5-9 months (n=22) as well as examining population measures for a larger sample (n=165). Replicating previous findings, threat of shock improved distractor accuracy and slowed target reaction time on this task. Critically, both within-subject self-report measures of stress (ICC=0.74) and stress-potentiated task performance (ICC=0.58) showed clinically useful test-retest reliability. Threat-potentiated task performance may therefore hold promise as a non-subjective measure of individual stress-reactivity.},

	abstract = {Worry refers to the experience of uncontrollable negative thoughts. Cognitive models suggest that the combination of negative information processing biases along with diminished attentional control contribute to worry. In the current study we investigate whether promoting a) adaptive interpretation bias and b) efficient deployment of attentional control would influence the tendency to worry. Worry-prone individuals (n = 60) received either active cognitive bias modification for interpretation bias (CBM-I) combined with sham working memory training (WMT), adaptive WMT combined with sham CBM-I, or sham WMT combined with sham CBM-I. Neither of the active training conditions reduced worry during a breathing focus task relative to the control condition. However, when considering inter-individual differences in training-related improvements, we observed a relation between increases in positive interpretation bias and a decrease in negative intrusions. Moreover, increases in working memory performance were related to a reduction in reactivity of negative intrusions to a worry period. Our findings show that facilitating a more benign interpretation bias and improving working memory capacity can have beneficial effects in terms of worry, but also highlight that transfer related gains from existing training procedures can be dependent upon improvement levels on the training task.},

The rapid growth and popularity, however, have come with a definitional imbroglio, as there seem to be as many conceptualizations of emotion as there are emotion researchers. This chapter begins by presenting an increasingly common conceptualization of emotion and emphasizes key distinctions used in emotion research. Next, multiple event-related potential (ERP) components sensitive to emotional content and the time course of emotional processing are highlighted. Then, how that time course can be clarified through data reduction techniques is examined, with examples provided. Subsequently, methodological issues are outlined, with the key decisions about ERP elicitation and measurement specified. Event-related potential findings related to clinical, developmental, and aging applications in the psychology of emotion are summarized. Finally, speculation on the future of emotion research using ERPs is proffered in terms of key questions to be answered.},

This chapter reviews the findings of studies measuring ERPs in depressed patients during a variety of sensory, cognitive, and emotional tasks in order to contribute to a better understanding of the specific processes and neurophysiological mechanisms that are dysfunctional in depressive disorders. It highlights the clinical relevance of ERP findings in depressed patients by describing the relation of patients‚Äô ERPs to their clinical features, most notably severity of depressive symptoms, diagnostic subtype, and therapeutic response to treatments. From a methodological perspective, it presents new findings illustrating the power of combining current source density (CSD) and principal components analysis (PCA) techniques, which take better advantage of both the temporal resolution of ERPs and the spatial resolution of dense electrode arrays than traditional analysis methods of reference-dependent surface potentials.},

The next section describes the problems involved in isolating individual ERP components from the observed waveform, which is often much more difficult than researchers realize. This is followed by a discussion of the challenges involved in linking an ERP component with a specific neural or psychological process and then using this link to answer broader questions about the mind and brain.

The LRP has also been used to measure the preliminary activation of a response that is never actually produced. The LRP is a valuable measure of relatively central response activation that is now widely used in many areas of psychology involving reaction time tasks.

	abstract = {Poor research design and data analysis encourage false-positive findings. Such poor methods persist despite perennial calls for improvement, suggesting that they result from something more than just misunderstanding. The persistence of poor methods results partly from incentives that favor them, leading to the natural selection of bad science. This dynamic requires no conscious strategizing---no deliberate cheating nor loafing---by scientists, only that publication is a principle factor for career advancement. Some normative methods of analysis have almost certainly been selected to further publication instead of discovery. In order to improve the culture of science, a shift must be made away from correcting misunderstandings and towards rewarding understanding. We support this argument with empirical evidence and computational modeling. We first present a 60-year meta-analysis of statistical power in the behavioral sciences and show that power has not improved despite repeated demonstrations of the necessity of increasing power. To demonstrate the logical consequences of structural incentives, we then present a dynamic model of scientific communities in which competing laboratories investigate novel or previously published hypotheses using culturally transmitted research methods. As in the real world, successful labs produce more "progeny", such that their methods are more often copied and their students are more likely to start labs of their own. Selection for high output leads to poorer methods and increasingly high false discovery rates. We additionally show that replication slows but does not stop the process of methodological deterioration. Improving the quality of research requires change at the institutional level.},

	abstract = {All psychological processes-like biological and social ones-are dynamic. Phenomena of nature, society, and the human psyche are context bound, constantly changing, and variable. This feature of reality is often not recognized in the social sciences where we operate with averaged data and with homogeneous stereotypes, and consider our consistency to be the cornerstone of rational being. Yet we are all inconsistent in our actions within a day, or from, one day to the next, and much of such inconsistency is of positive value for our survival and development. Our inconsistent behaviors and thoughts may appear chaotic, yet there is generality within this highly variable dynamic.The task of scientific methodologies-qualitative and quantitative-is to find out what that generality is. It is the aim of this handbook to bring into one framework various directions of construction of methodology of the dynamic processes that exist in the social sciences at the beginning of the 21st century. This handbook is set up to bring together pertinent methodological scholarship from all over the world, and equally from the quantitative and qualitative orientations to methodology. In addition to consolidating the pertinent knowledge base for the purposes of its further growth, this book serves the major educational role of bringing practitioners-students, researchers, and professionals interested in applications-the state of the art know-how about how to think about extracting evidence from single cases, and about the formal mathematical-statistical tools to use for these purposes.

	abstract = {My aim in this essay is to raise the question "Is there such a thing as mental illness?" and to argue that there is not. Since the notion of mental illness is extremely widely used nowadays, inquiry into the ways in which this term is employed would seem to be especially indicated. Mental illness, of course, is not literally a "thing" -- or physical object -- and hence it can "exist" only in the same sort of way in which other theoretical concepts exist. Yet, familiar theories are in the habit of posing, sooner or later -- at least to those who come to believe in them -- as "objective truths" (or "facts"). During certain historical periods, explanatory conceptions such as deities, witches, and microorganisms appeared not only as theories but as self-evident causes of a vast number of events. I submit that today mental illness is widely regarded in a somewhat similar fashion, that is, as the cause of innumerable diverse happenings. As an antidote to the complacent use of the notion of mental illness -- whether as a self-evident phenomenon, theory, or cause-- let us ask this question: What is meant when it is asserted that someone is mentally ill? In what follows I shall describe briefly the main uses to which the concept of mental illness has been put. I shall argue that this notion has outlived whatever usefulness it might have had and that it now functions merely as a convenient myth.},

Therefore we examined validity effects for facial expressions of different emotions (compared to neutral faces) with a dot-probe paradigm in seven studies (total N = 308). Systematic variations of type of emotion, CTI, task, cue size, and masking allow for a differentiated assessment of attentional capture by emotions and possible moderating factors. Results indicate a general absence of emotional validity effects as well as a lack of significant interactions with either of the manipulated factors, indicating that facial expressions of emotions do not capture attention in a fully automatic fashion. These findings suggest that situational and contextual factors have to be taken into account when investigating attentional capture of emotional faces. ARTICLE HISTORY},

Concepts of the central regulation of action offer an integrative framework for understanding the psychophysiology of preparation. If people process multiple streams of information concurrently, then preparatory processing requires a form of supervisory attention- central regulation to maintain unity of action. This concept is consistent with existing psychophysiological results and links them to current views of information processing. Conversely, psychophysiological measures may provide indices to test concepts within theories of the central regulation of action.},

In addition, those who switched more efficiently from an emotional set to a neutral set persisted longer on the stressful task.

Attentional control capacity for emotion (ACCE) was measured by adapting a task-switching paradigm where participants had to shift between emotional and neutral task sets. Undergraduate students (N=91) were randomly assigned to perform either a task measuring ACCE or an emotionally neutral switching task to determine the discriminant validity of ACCE. ACCE predicted behaviour during a stressful anagram task. Individuals who were more efficient at an emotional to neutral task switch persisted longer on the stressful task. In contrast, individuals who more efficient at a neutral to emotional task switch persisted for a shorter time on the stressful task.

The current study used event-related potentials (ERPs) to evaluate whether worry affects anticipation and processing of threat and neutral pictures during a conditioning task. Fifty-two high (n= 24) and low (n= 28) worriers completed a paradigm in which a neutral stimulus indicated the valence of a second stimulus, either a threat or neutral picture. Results found that worriers displayed reduced anticipatory responses to both stimulus types as indexed by the stimulus preceding negativity, although they displayed an increased stimulus preceding negativity to threatening images during the second half of the task. In addition, high and low worriers differed in processing of threat and neutral images as indexed by the late positive potential. These findings support the overgeneralization of fear literature, suggesting that worriers display difficulty discriminating safety cues from threat cues, and this affects the attentional resources devoted to subsequent stimuli. Implications of these results are discussed.},

	abstract = {Objectives. Overgeneral autobiographical memory (OGM) refers to the impaired retrieval of speciÔ¨Åc events from autobiographical memory. This review examined OGM in children and adolescents to answer three main questions. First, do children demonstrate OGM? Second, how does the experience of OGM relate to childhood trauma and associated psychopathology? Third, is the CaR-FA-X model (Williams et al., 2007) able to explain OGM in child psychopathology once developmental issues have been considered?
Method. Articles were identiÔ¨Åed in PsycINFO and PubMed searches using the terms overgeneral memory AND children, autobiographical memory speciÔ¨Åcity AND children, and autobiographical memory AND children. The authors reviewed 21 articles that examined OGM in young people aged 7‚Äì18 years. Effect sizes were calculated for each study.
Results. The review demonstrated consistent support for a relationship with trauma exposure and depression symptoms in childhood. Furthermore, OGM was found to predict depression symptoms. Limited support was provided for the efÔ¨Åcacy of the CaR-FA-X model in young people.
Conclusions. Future research will need to examine the inÔ¨Çuence of trauma characteristics on OGM development, along with the relationship of OGM to depression prognosis. Further investigation of the CaR-FA-X model is required and developmental aspects will need to be taken into account.},

We show that these correlations are higher than should be expected given the (evidently limited) reliability of both fMRI and personality measures. The high correlations are all the more puzzling because method sections rarely contain much detail about how the correlations were obtained. We surveyed authors of 55 articles that reported Ô¨Åndings of this kind to determine a few details on how these correlations were computed. More than half acknowledged using a strategy that computes separate correlations for individual voxels and reports means of only those voxels exceeding chosen thresholds. We show how this nonindependent analysis inÔ¨Çates correlations while yielding reassuring-looking scattergrams. This analysis technique was used to obtain the vast majority of the implausibly high correlations in our survey sample. In addition, we argue that, in some cases, other analysis problems likely created entirely spurious correlations. We outline how the data from these studies could be reanalyzed with unbiased methods to provide accurate estimates of the correlations in question and urge authors to perform such reanalyses. The underlying problems described here appear to be common in fMRI research of many kinds‚Äînot just in studies of emotion, personality, and social cognition.},

	abstract = {Recent efforts have been made to understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying psychological resilience. Cognitive flexibility in the context of affective information has been related to individual differences in resilience. However, it is unclear whether flexible affective processing is sensitive to mood fluctuations. Furthermore, it remains to be investigated how effects on flexible affective processing interact with the affective valence of information that is presented. To fill this gap, we tested the effects of positive mood and individual differences in self-reported resilience on affective flexibility, using a task switching paradigm (N œ≠ 80). The main findings showed that positive mood was related to lower task switching costs, reflecting increased flexibility, in line with previous findings. In line with this effect of positive mood, we showed that greater resilience levels, specifically levels of acceptance of self and life, also facilitated task set switching in the context of affective information. However, the effects of resilience on affective flexibility seem more complex. Resilience tended to relate to more efficient task switching when negative information was preceded by positive information, possibly because the presentation of positive information, as well as positive mood, can facilitate task set switching. Positive mood also influenced costs associated with switching affective valence of the presented information. This latter effect was indicative of a reduced impact of no longer relevant negative information and more impact of no longer relevant positive information. Future research should confirm these effects of individual differences in resilience on affective flexibility, considering the affective valence of the presented information.},

Cronbach‚Äôs alpha is often viewed as some kind of quality label: high values certify scale quality, low values prompt removal of one or several items. Unfortunately, this approach suffers two fundamental problems. First, Cronbach‚Äôs alpha is both unrelated to a scale's internal consistency and a fatally flawed estimate of its reliability. Second, the approach itself assumes that scale items are repeated measurements, an assumption that is often violated and rarely desirable. The problems with Cronbach‚Äôs alpha are easily solved by computing readily available alternatives, such as the Greatest Lower Bound or Omega. Solving the second problem, however, is less straightforward. This requires forgoing the appealing comfort of a quantitative, seemingly objective indicator of scale quality altogether, instead acknowledging the dynamics of reliability and validity and the distinction between scales and indices. In this contribution, I will explore these issues, and provide recommendations for scale inspection that takes these dynamics and this distinction into account.},

	abstract = {Background: Anxiety vulnerability is associated with biases in attention: a tendency to selectively process negative relative to neutral or positive information. It is not clear whether this bias is: 1) related to the physiological response to stressful events, and 2) causally related to the development of anxiety disorders.
Methods: We tested the predictive value of both preconscious and conscious attention biases in a prospective study of stress reactivity in a nonclinical sample. One hundred four male participants were assessed at baseline and then again 4 months (n œ≠ 82) and 8 months later (n œ≠ 70). Salivary cortisol and self-report measures were obtained at the baseline testing session in addition to measures of biased attention. Subsequent emotional reactivity was assessed by means of salivary cortisol and self-reported state-anxiety responses during a laboratorybased stressor (4 months later) as well as during a real-life stressor 8 months later (i.e., examination period).
Results: Regression analyses indicated that a preconscious negative processing bias was the best predictor of the cortisol response to stressful events. Importantly, a measure of selective processing provided a better indicator of subsequent emotional reactivity than self-report measures of neuroticism, trait-anxiety, and extraversion.
Conclusions: These results suggest that preconscious biases toward negative material play a causal role in heightened anxiety vulnerability. Our results illustrate the potential utility of preconscious biases in attention in providing an early marker of anxiety vulnerability and a potential target for treatment intervention.},

	abstract = {Background: Attention bias modiÔ¨Åcation (ABM) procedures have been shown to modify biased attention with important implications for emotional vulnerability and resilience. The use of ABM to reduce potentially toxic biases, for instance, is a newly emerging therapy for anxiety disorders. A separate line of gene-by-environment interaction research proposes that many so-called vulnerability genes or risk alleles are better seen as plasticity genes, as they seem to make individuals more susceptible to environmental inÔ¨Çuences for better and for worse.
Methods: A standard ABM procedure was used with a sample of 116 healthy adults. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two training groups. One received an ABM procedure designed to induce a bias in attention toward negative material, while the other was trained toward positive pictures. Individuals with low- and high-expressing forms of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) were compared.
Results: Those with a low-expression form (S/S, S/Lg, or Lg/Lg) of the 5-HTTLPR gene developed stronger biases for both negative and positive affective pictures relative to those with the high-expression (La/La) form of the gene.
Conclusions: Here, we report the Ô¨Årst evidence that allelic variation in the promotor region of the 5-HTTLPR gene predicts different degrees of sensitivity to ABM. These results suggest a potential cognitive mechanism for the gene-by-environment interactions that have been found in relation to the serotonin transporter gene. Variation on this genotype may therefore determine who will beneÔ¨Åt most (and least) from therapeutic interventions, adversity, and supportive environments.},

Several authors have argued that CBM-A in fact trains top-down, reactive counteraction of the tendency to orient towards threat. Imposing a working memory (WM) load during training should therefore limit its efÔ¨Åcacy, since WM resources are required for goal-driven control of attention. Twenty-eight subclinical high-anxious participants completed two sessions of CBM-A or placebo training: one under a high WM load, and one under a low WM load. Attentional bias was assessed after each training. CBM-A produced an attentional bias away from threat under low load, but not under high load. These results suggest CBM-A trains top-down counteraction of orienting to threat. It also suggests the administration of CBM-A in the home environment may be affected by everyday worries and distractions.},

In a novel CBM procedure participants read either positive or negative statements relating to social issues for 5 min. Interpretation bias was measured by means of a scrambled sentence test, which was presented both before and after the CBM procedure. Participants who read the positive statements made more positive resolutions to the scrambled sentences, while participants who read the negative statements made more negative resolutions. Thus, the appropriate positive and negative interpretative biases were induced by the CBM procedure. However, signiÔ¨Åcant mood changes also occurred following CBM. In Experiment 2, a musical mood induction procedure was presented with depressing or elating music. As before, a scrambled sentence test was presented both before and after the musical mood induction. Mood changed in accordance with the valence of the music to the same extent as with CBM. Critically however, performance on the scrambled sentence task did not change for both groups. This demonstrates that a change in mood state is not sufÔ¨Åcient for a change in cognitive bias to occur.},

The aim of this paper was to investigate whether and how routine activities promote flourishing. The authors proposed that flourishers thrive because they capitalize on the processes featured in the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions, specifically by experiencing greater positive emotional reactivity to pleasant events and building more resources over time. To test these hypotheses, the Day Reconstruction Method (DRM) was administered to a prescreened community sample of adults (n œ≠ 208), and they were recontacted two to three months later. Results showed that relative to those who did not flourish or were depressed, people who flourish generally responded with bigger ‚Äúboosts‚Äù in positive emotions in response to everyday, pleasant events (helping, interacting, playing, learning, spiritual activity), and this greater positive emotional reactivity, over time, predicted higher levels of two facets of the cognitive resource of mindfulness. In turn, these higher levels of mindfulness were positively associated with higher levels of flourishing at the end of study, controlling for initial levels of flourishing. These results suggest that the promotion of well-being may be fueled by small, yet consequential differences in individuals‚Äô emotional experience of pleasant everyday events. Additionally, these results underscore the utility of the broadenand-build theory in understanding the processes by which flourishing is promoted and provide support for a positive potentiation perspective.},

	abstract = {Objective: Cortisol is elevated in individuals with both increased emotional stress and higher percentages of body fat. Cortisol is also known to affect cognitive performance, particularly spatial processing and working memory. We hypothesized that increased body fat might therefore be associated with decreased performance on a spatial processing task, in response to an acute real-world stressor. Design: We tested two separate samples of participants undergoing their first (tandem) skydive. In the first sample (N ¬º 78), participants were tested for salivary cortisol and state anxiety (Spielberger State Anxiety Scale) during the plane‚Äôs 15-min ascent to altitude in immediate anticipation of the jump. In a second sample (N ¬º 20), participants were tested for salivary cortisol, as well as cardiac variables (heart rate, autonomic regulation through heart rate variability) and performance on a cognitive task of spatial processing, selective attention and working memory.
Results: In response to the skydive, individuals with greater body fat percentages showed significantly increased reactivity for both cortisol (on both samples) and cognition, including decreased accuracy of our task of spatial processing, selective attention and working memory. These cognitive effects were restricted to the stress response and were not found under baseline conditions. There were no body fat interactions with cardiac changes in response to the stressor, suggesting that the cognitive effects were specifically hormone mediated rather than secondary to general activation of the autonomic nervous system.
Conclusions: Our results indicate that, under real-world stress, increased body fat may be associated with endocrine stress vulnerability, with consequences for deleterious cognitive performance.

Methods: Data from the 1998 National Health Interview Survey were linked to prospective National Death Index mortality data through 2006. Separate logistic regression models were used to examine the factors associated with current health status and psychological distress. Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine the impact of perceiving that stress affects health on all-cause mortality. Each model specifically examined the interaction between the amount of stress and the perception that stress affects health, controlling for sociodemographic, health behavior, and access to health care factors. Results: 33.7\% of nearly 186 million (unweighted n œ≠ 28,753) U.S. adults perceived that stress affected their health a lot or to some extent. Both higher levels of reported stress and the perception that stress affects health were independently associated with an increased likelihood of worse health and mental health outcomes. The amount of stress and the perception that stress affects health interacted such that those who reported a lot of stress and that stress impacted their health a lot had a 43\% increased risk of premature death (HR œ≠ 1.43, 95\% CI [1.2, 1.7]). Conclusions: High amounts of stress and the perception that stress impacts health are each associated with poor health and mental health.

	abstract = {Depression has been widely associated with a cognitive deÔ¨Åcit leading to the negative interpretation of ambiguous information. Recently, cognitive bias modiÔ¨Åcation (CBM) procedures have shown that such negative biases are causally related to emotional vulnerability. However, research using CBM has been notably lacking in depression. This is the Ô¨Årst double blind randomised controlled study investigating the effect of cognitive bias modiÔ¨Åcation-errors (CBM-errors), on depression and its inÔ¨Çuence on mood and resilience to stress. CBM-errors is a new form of cognitive bias modiÔ¨Åcation for interpretation, which targets the full range of cognitive errors, as well as interpretation biases. Forty clinically depressed participants were randomly allocated to a positive training group or neutral text reading control group. Participants trained to make positive interpretations subsequently interpreted novel ambiguous information in a positive manner compared to controls. The results suggest that a positive cognitive bias can be induced in clinically depressed individuals using a simple computerised intervention. There was little evidence of corresponding beneÔ¨Åts in terms of mood or response to stress, suggesting that multiple sessions are likely to be needed to confer symptom related change. A systematic investigation of the optimum number and timing of multiple sessions is now called for.},

	abstract = {Purpose: In clinical practice, it is often noted that some individuals struggle with chronic pain, while others find effective means to cope. The purpose of this study was to better understand how resilience fits into coping with persistent pain problems. Of interest was whether measures of resilience add to the prediction of adjustment to chronic pain over and above measures of pain coping as typically used with this patient group. Method: Individuals (N œ≠ 101) with chronic pain who attended an initial assessment at a pain clinic completed self-report measures of resilience and coping. Pain related outcome data were also collected. Results: Bivariate correlations indicated that higher resilience was associated with significantly less fear avoidance, less pain-related disability, and lower reported pain intensity. Consistent with theoretical propositions, bivariate analyses also indicated that more resilient individuals with chronic pain reported better social support, and were more likely to be working. Higher resilience was also positively correlated with greater pain self-efficacy. However, when hierarchical regression analyses were performed, resilience did not add significantly to the prediction of depression scores and disability scores, over and above the contribution made by existing measures of pain coping. Conclusion: These findings suggest that, although the construct of resilience appears to have important relationships with various dimensions of chronic pain, as currently operationalized, it does not add significantly to the understanding of chronic-pain adjustment. Rather than abandoning the resilience construct, our findings suggest that resilience as applied to the problem of chronic pain may require a refinement in measurement with this population.},

However, it is not known if this heterogeneity inÔ¨Çuences the risk for developing stress related disorders or if it is a biological consequence of the stress response itself. Determining if glucocorticoid response to stress induction prospectively predicts psychological vulnerability to signiÔ¨Åcant real life stressors can adjudicate this issue. To test this relationship, salivary cortisol as well as catecholamine responses to a laboratory stressor during academy training were examined as predictors of empirically identiÔ¨Åed distress trajectories through the subsequent 4 years of active duty among urban police ofÔ¨Åcers routinely exposed to potentially traumatic events and routine life stressors (N ¬º 234). During training, ofÔ¨Åcers were exposed to a video vignette of police ofÔ¨Åcers exposed to real-life trauma. Changes in salivary 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) and cortisol in response to this video challenge were examined as predictors of trajectory membership while controlling for age, gender, and baseline neuroendocrine levels. OfÔ¨Åcers who followed trajectories of resilience and recovery over 4 years mounted signiÔ¨Åcant increases in cortisol in response to the experimental stressor, while those following a trajectory of chronic increasing distress had no signiÔ¨Åcant cortisol change in response to the challenge. MHPG responses were not associated with distress trajectories. Cortisol response prospectively differentiated trajectories of distress response suggesting that a blunted cortisol response to a laboratory stressor is a risk factor for later vulnerability to distress following signiÔ¨Åcant life stressors.},

A double dissociation was observed. The SERT polymorphism altered behavioral adaptation after losses, with increased lose-shift associated with L0 homozygosity, while leaving unaffected perseveration after reversal. In contrast, the DAT1 genotype affected the inÔ¨Çuence of prior choices on perseveration, while leaving lose-shifting unaltered. A model of reinforcement learning captured the dose-dependent effect of DAT1 genotype, such that an increasing number of 9R-alleles resulted in a stronger reliance on previous experience and therefore reluctance to update learned associations. These data provide direct evidence for doubly dissociable effects of serotonin and dopamine systems.},

The present study sought to examine whether such anxiety-linked attentional biases were associated with either stimulus driven or attentional control mechanisms of attentional selectivity. High and low trait anxious participants completed an emotional variant of an antisaccade task, in which they were required to prosaccade towards, or antisaccade away from a positive, neutral or threat stimulus, while eye movements were recorded. While low anxious participants were found to be slower to saccade in response to positive stimuli, irrespectively of whether a pro- or antisaccade was required, such a bias was absent in high anxious individuals. Analysis of erroneous antisaccades further revealed at trend level, that anxiety was associated with reduced peak velocity in response to threat. The findings suggest that anxiety is associated with the aberrant processing of positive stimuli, and greater compensatory efforts in the inhibition of threat. The findings further highlight the relevance of considering saccade peak velocity in the assessment of anxiety-linked attentional processing.},

	abstract = {Memory impairment is the most commonly reported cognitive symptom associated with major depressive disorder. Decreased hippocampal volume and neurogenesis in depression link hippocampal dysfunction with deÔ¨Åcits in memory. Stress decreases hippocampal dendritic spine density and long-term potentiation (LTP) at glutamate synapses, a cellular correlate of learning and memory. However, elevated plasma levels of 17b estradiol (E2) during proestrus increase hippocampal structure and function, directly opposing the negative consequences of stress. In women, signiÔ¨Åcant Ô¨Çuctuations in ovarian hormones likely increase vulnerability of hippocampal circuits to stress, potentially contributing to the greater incidence of depression compared to men. Using the learned helplessness model of depression and ovariectomized female rats, we investigated whether acquisition of helplessness and hippocampal synaptic dysfunction is differentially impacted by the presence or absence of plasma E2. We Ô¨Ånd that inescapable shock induces a greater incidence of helplessness in vehicle- versus E2-treated OVX rats. In the vehicletreated group, LTP was absent at CA3-CA1 synapses in slices only from helpless rats, and CA1 spine density was decreased compared to resilient rats. In contrast, signiÔ¨Åcant LTP was observed in slices from E2-treated helpless rats; importantly, spine density was not different between E2treated helpless and resilient rats, dissociating spine density from the LTP magnitude. We also Ô¨Ånd that E2 replacement can reverse previously established helpless behavior. Thus, our results show that E2 replacement in OVX rats increases resilience and improves hippocampal plasticity, suggesting that E2 therapy may increase resilience to stress and preserve hippocampal function in women experiencing large Ô¨Çuctuations in plasma estrogen levels.},

	abstract = {Animals that experience adverse events in early life often have life-long changes to their physiology and behavior. Long-term effects of stress during early life have been studied extensively, but less attention has been given to the consequences of negative experiences solely during the adolescent phase. Adolescence is a particularly sensitive period of life when regulation of the glucocorticoid ‚Äústress‚Äù hormone response matures and speciÔ¨Åc regions in the brain undergo considerable change. Aversive experiences during this time might, therefore, be expected to generate long-term consequences for the adult phenotype. Here we investigated the long-term effects of exposure to chronic unpredictable stress during adolescence on adult decision-making, coping response, cognitive bias, and exploratory behavior in rats. Rats exposed to chronic unpredictable stress (e.g., isolation, crowding, cage tilt) were compared to control animals that were maintained in standard, predictable conditions throughout development. Unpredictable stress during adolescence resulted in a suite of long-term behavioral and cognitive changes including a negative cognitive bias [F(1, 12) = 5.000, P {\textless} 0.05], altered coping response [T(1,14) = 2.216, P = 0.04], and accelerated decision-making [T(1,14) = 3.245, P = 0.01]. Exposure to chronic stress during adolescence also caused a short-term increase in boldness behaviors; in a novel object test 15 days after the last stressor, animals exposed to chronic unpredictable stress had decreased latencies to leave a familiar shelter and approach a novel object [T(1,14) = 2.240, P = 0.04; T(1,14) = 2.419, P = 0.03, respectively]. The results showed that stress during adolescence has long-term impacts on behavior and cognition that affect the interpretation of ambiguous stimuli, behavioral response to adverse events, and how animals make decisions.},

	abstract = {Background: Stress plays an important role in the onset and recurrence of bipolar disorder (BD). Resilience is the ability to cope with stress or adversity. Few studies have examined resilience in BD, and this study aimed to investigate the clinical correlates of resilience in euthymic patients with BD.
Methods: A total of 62 outpatients with BD type I, II, and not otherwise speciÔ¨Åed (NOS) who were in remission and 62 healthy individuals matched with the BD group in terms of age and sex were recruited. All participants completed the Connor‚ÄìDavidson Resilience Scale and Barratt Impulsiveness Scale. A psychiatrist interviewed the subjects to assess clinical characteristics. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with resilience.
Results: The BD group had signiÔ¨Åcantly higher levels of impulsivity and lower levels of resilience compared with the control group. Degree of impulsivity, number of depressive episodes, Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scores, and length of education were signiÔ¨Åcantly correlated with resilience. Attention impulsivity, non-planning impulsivity, and number of depressive episodes were associated with low levels of resilience, even when age, sex, length of education, and CGI scores were controlled. Limitations: Because tertiary hospital patients were recruited, the generalizability of the Ô¨Åndings is limited.
Conclusions: This study shows that low levels of resilience are related to high levels of impulsivity and to an increased number of depressive episodes in euthymic patients with BD. Given the reciprocal relationship between resilience and impulsivity, efforts to enhance resilience and reduce impulsivity may make important contributions to the treatment of patients with BD.},

The etiology of these trajectories is still unclear. Individual differences in levels of negative and positive emotion are believed to play a role in determining risk and resilience following traumatic exposure. In the current investigation, we followed police officers prospectively from academy training through 48 months of active duty, assessing levels of distress every 12 months. Using latent class growth analysis, we identified 4 trajectories closely conforming to prototypical patterns. Furthermore, we found that lower levels of self-reported negative emotion during academy training prospectively predicted membership in the resilient trajectory compared with the more symptomatic trajectories following the initiation of active duty, whereas higher levels of positive emotion during academy training differentiated resilience from a trajectory that was equivalently low on distress during academy training but consistently grew in distress through 4 years of active duty. These findings emerging from a prospective longitudinal design provide evidence that resilience is predicted by both lower levels of negative emotion and higher levels of positive emotion prior to active duty stressor exposure.},

	abstract = {Current concepts of the neurobiology of stress-related disorders, such as anxiety and depression emphasize disruptions in neural plasticity and neurotrophins.The potent trophic actions of exercise, therefore, represent not only an effective means for prevention and treatment of these disorders, they also afford the opportunity to employ exercise paradigms as a basic research tool to uncover the neurobiological mechanisms underlying these disorders. Novel approaches to studying stress-related disorders focus increasingly on trophic factor signaling in corticolimbic circuits that both mediate and regulate cognitive, behavioral, and physiological responses to deleterious stress. Recent evidence demonstrates that the neural plasticity supported by these trophic mechanisms is vital for establishing and maintaining resilience to stress. Therapeutic interventions that promote these mechanisms, be they pharmacological, behavioral, or environmental, may therefore prevent or reverse stress-related mental illness by enhancing resilience. The present paper will provide an overview of trophic mechanisms responsible for the enhancement of resilience by voluntary exercise with an emphasis on brain-derived neurotrophic factor, galanin, and interactions between these two trophic factors.},

	abstract = {Eliminating the controllability of a noxious stimulus may induce a learned helplessness (LH) that resembles aspects of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study examined whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) promotes resilience in an aversive stimulus model of LH. All 55 participants were told that an undisclosed sequence of button presses would terminate an aversive stimulus on their forearm. In truth, only half had control (√æ C). The other half had no control ( √Ä C). All participants received real (R) or sham (S) left DLPFC rTMS during the paradigm ( √æC/R, √Ä C/S,√æ C/S, √Ä C/R). We evaluated the cognitive effects of LH using an anagram task. The LH paradigm successfully reduced perceived control in the √Ä C groups. As predicted, the √æC/R and √æ C/S groups tended to give up less quickly and take less time to solve each anagram than did the √Ä C/S group. Superior anagram performance in the √Ä C/R group approached statistical signiÔ¨Åcance. Our preliminary results suggest that manipulating the controllability of an aversive stimulus may induce an LH effect that manifests as impaired anagram performance. Further research is needed to reÔ¨Åne this model and determine if DLPFC rTMS mitigates any LH effects.},

	abstract = {Depression has been widely associated with a cognitive deÔ¨Åcit leading to the negative interpretation of ambiguous information. Recently, cognitive bias modiÔ¨Åcation (CBM) procedures have shown that such negative biases are causally related to emotional vulnerability. However, research using CBM has been notably lacking in depression. This is the Ô¨Årst double blind randomised controlled study investigating the effect of cognitive bias modiÔ¨Åcation-errors (CBM-errors), on depression and its inÔ¨Çuence on mood and resilience to stress. CBM-errors is a new form of cognitive bias modiÔ¨Åcation for interpretation, which targets the full range of cognitive errors, as well as interpretation biases. Forty clinically depressed participants were randomly allocated to a positive training group or neutral text reading control group. Participants trained to make positive interpretations subsequently interpreted novel ambiguous information in a positive manner compared to controls. The results suggest that a positive cognitive bias can be induced in clinically depressed individuals using a simple computerised intervention. There was little evidence of corresponding beneÔ¨Åts in terms of mood or response to stress, suggesting that multiple sessions are likely to be needed to confer symptom related change. A systematic investigation of the optimum number and timing of multiple sessions is now called for.},

I also underscore the necessity of modeling nonlinear effects of positivity ratios and, more generally, the value of systems science approaches within affective science and positive psychology. Even when scrubbed of Losada‚Äôs now-questioned mathematical modeling, ample evidence continues to support the conclusion that, within bounds, higher positivity ratios are predictive of Ô¨Çourishing mental health and other beneÔ¨Åcial outcomes.},

Pre-treatment strengths (hope, spirituality, appreciation of beauty and excellence) predicted post-treatment recovery from depression; cognitive vulnerabilities did not. Strengths and vulnerabilities sometimes interacted, with strengths weakening the relationship between vulnerabilities and well-being.

The development of psychological interventions to boost optimism derived from cognitive science would have the potential to provide signiÔ¨Åcant public health beneÔ¨Åts, yet cognitive markers of optimism are little understood. The current study aimed to take a Ô¨Årst step in this direction by identifying a cognitive marker for optimism that could provide a modiÔ¨Åable target for innovative interventions. In particular we predicted that the ability to generate vivid positive mental imagery of the future would be associated with dispositional optimism. A community sample of 237 participants completed a survey comprising measures of mental imagery and optimism, and socio-demographic information. Vividness of positive future imagery was signiÔ¨Åcantly associated with optimism, even when adjusting for socio-demographic factors and everyday imagery use. The ability to generate vivid mental imagery of positive future events may provide a modiÔ¨Åable cognitive marker of optimism. Boosting positive future imagery could provide a cognitive target for treatment innovations to promote optimism, with implications for mental health and even physical wellbeing.},

This multi-disciplinary review explores past attempts to define wellbeing and provides an overview of the main theoretical perspectives, from the work of Aristotle to the present day. The article argues that many attempts at expressing its nature have focused purely on dimensions of wellbeing, rather than on definition. Among these theoretical perspectives, we highlight the pertinence of dynamic equilibrium theory of wellbeing (Headey \& Wearing, 1989), the effect of life challenges on homeostasis (Cummins, 2010) and the lifespan model of development (Hendry \& Kloep, 2002). Consequently, we conclude that it would be appropriate for a new definition of wellbeing to centre on a state of equilibrium or balance that can be affected by life events or challenges. The article closes by proposing this new definition, which we believe to be simple, universal in application, optimistic and a basis for measurement. This definition conveys the multi-faceted nature of wellbeing and can help individuals and policy makers move forward in their understanding of this popular term.},

Over the last few years, academic debate has, from a scientific perspective, gone back to two ancient philosophical orientations, namely hedonism and eudaimonia. The hedonic approach conceives well-being as the presence of positive affect and lack of negative affect, whilst the eudaimonic perspective regards well-being as the consequence of a full psychological actualization from which people develop their whole potential. Whether assessed from a hedonic or eudaimonic perspective, well-being seems to play a role in the prevention of and in the recovery of physical conditions and diseases and so possibly contributes to an increase in life expectancy. Finally, the implications of these findings are discussed both from an academic perspective and, more generally speaking, from a social and political point of view.},

	abstract = {Background: The objectives of the study were to explore a self-report measure for psychological well-being and to investigate the relationship between psychological well-being and psychological distress.
Method: Telephone interviews of a representative sample of adults (N = 1933) collected information about sociodemographic variables, a standardised measure of psychological distress, and three brief existing scales to assess aspects of psychological well-being: Positive Relations with Others, Environmental Mastery, and Satisfaction with Life. The total of these three scales was also computed and explored as a measure of overall well-being.
Results: Variables positively associated with psychological well-being were negatively associated with psychological distress and vice versa. For example low psychological well-being and high psychological distress were associated with being the only adult in the household, speaking a language other than English at home, being divorced or separated, having no educational qualifications beyond secondary school, being unable to work, having a low income, renting one‚Äôs accommodation, and receiving a pension.
Conclusions: The measure of well-being shows psychometric promise for community surveys. Psychological well-being is not exactly the opposite end of the continuum to psychological distress, but more debate is needed about whether and when, research participants need to be asked questions about both.},

	abstract = {The aim of this article is to consider debates around the contested nature of concepts of wellbeing in health and social science research and practice, given that government policy discourse centres on the importance of wellbeing as a tool for making policy and evaluating outcomes. It draws attention to the work of McNaught (2011). He has developed a definitional framework of wellbeing, in which wellbeing is perceived to be a macro concept or area of study concerned with the objective and subjective assessment of wellbeing as a desirable human state. The framework broadens wellbeing to a range of different domains beyond individual subjectivity, which has been the traditional focus of concern, and extracts it from customary affiliations with health to incorporate the family, community and society as a whole. The framework reflects the conceptual complexity of ‚Äòwellbeing‚Äô and highlights its dependency upon a range of social, economic and environmental forces that provide the resources and the contexts for the generation and maintenance of wellbeing at all levels of society. The article argues that the framework provides a paradigm that facilitates further development and systemisation of research and knowledge in the field of wellbeing. Firstly, the framework has the capacity to bring some clarity, inclusiveness and holism to research and practice. Secondly, it is useful as a tool to enhance theoretical frameworks and to guide the design and development of both health and wellbeing interventions. Thirdly, it provides the philosophical underpinnings for wellbeing policy development.},

The objective was to determine whether such a mechanism may be allostatic load, a novel concept specifying physiological systems that may suffer cumulative wear and tear following chronic stress, leading collectively to poor health. The study examines the association of allostatic load with environmental and psychological stress in the contexts of dementia caregiving and relinquishment of care, and is a 2-year longitudinal comparison of three groups: 80 new dementia spouse caregivers, 120 veteran caregivers, and 60 non-caregivers. Data comprised allostatic load markers and environmental and psychological stress measures. Cross-lagged analyses produced a statistically signiÔ¨Åcant association between psychological stress and one allostatic load component (primary mediators). Psychological stress was a better predictor of primary mediators than environmental stress. Primary mediators rose with time for caregivers, but not for non-caregivers. A greater rise was evident for caregivers who had relinquished their role by the second year, although the level of psychological stress actually declined. Primary mediators are a key component of the relationship between allostatic load and prior stress. When allostatic load is treated as an outcome of stress, it is important to distinguish environmental and psychological stress.},

However, little is known about the role of positive emotional processing in modulating anxiety reactivity to stress. In the current study, we used an attentional training paradigm designed to experimentally manipulate the processing of positive emotional cues. Participants were randomly assigned to complete a computerized probe detection task designed to induce selective processing of positive stimuli or to a sham condition. Following training, participants were exposed to a laboratory stressor (i.e., videotaped speech), and state anxiety and positive affect in response to the stressor were assessed. Results revealed that individual variability in the capacity to develop an attentional bias for positive information following training predicted subsequent emotional responses to the stressor. Moreover, individual differences in social anxiety, but not depression, moderated the effects of the attentional manipulation, such that, higher levels of social anxiety were associated with diminished attentional allocation toward positive cues. The current findings point to the potential value of considering the role of positive emotional processing in anxiety vulnerability.},

Empirical identification of pathways, or histories, requires measures that assess cumulative wear and tear on physiological systems following from psychosocial adversity and genetic predispositions. Such an assessment, allostatic load, has been shown to predict later life mortality, incident cardiovascular disease, and decline in physical and cognitive functioning. Using data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS), we seek precursors to allostatic load via ordered categories of cumulative adversity relative to advantage over the life course. We operationalize these histories via unfolding economic circumstances and social relationship experiences (e.g., parent‚Äìchild interactions, quality of spousal ties). Findings reveal a strong direct association between the extent of adversity relative to advantage in an ordering of these histories and likelihood of high allostatic load. Importantly, resilient individuals with economic disadvantage, but compensating positive social relationship histories also show low prevalence of high allostatic load.},

We addressed this issue by experimentally manipulating selective attentional response to positive information, using a cognitive bias modiÔ¨Åcation variant of the attentional probe task, and examining the impact of this attentional manipulation on positive emotional reactivity to a subsequent success experience. The Ô¨Åndings support the hypothesis that individual differences in selective attentional response to positive information can make a causal contribution to variation in positive affectivity.

We show that it is possible to experimentally modify biases in emotion recognition to encourage the perception of happiness over anger in ambiguous expressions. This change in perception results in a decrease in self-reported anger and aggression in healthy adults and high-risk youth, respectively, and also in independently rated aggressive behavior in high-risk youth. We obtained similar effects on mood using two different techniques to modify biases in emotion perception (feedback-based training and visual adaptation).

	abstract = {Studies on cognitive effects of positive emotions have associated positive emotions to broadened attention. Given the widely investigated relationship between self-focused attention and mood, it is important to investigate the effect of positive mood on visuospatial attention for self-related information. We used a performance-based measure to assess fluctuations in attentional broadening from self-related contrasted to not-self-related information. In Experiment 1, we checked that the self-related versus not-self-related stimuli did not evoke differential attention effects in general. In Experiment 2, we manipulated mood and found that an increase in positive mood was associated with a relative broadening of attention for self-related information. These results suggest that the meaning of the target of attention provides an interesting dimension for further investigation into the relation between positive emotions and attentional broadening.},

In both studies, individuals were selected after a successful sad mood induction procedure. A Dot Probe task, an Emotional Stroop task and a self-referential Incidental Learning and Free Recall task were administered to all participants. Principle component analyses indicated coherence between attentional and memory bias in nondepressed, while in formerly depressed individuals distinct components for attentional biases and for memory bias were uncovered. The data suggest that in formerly depressed individuals, self-referent processing during encoding may be related to memory bias, whereas in non-depressed individuals memory bias may be related to both attentional bias and self-referent processing.},

Across the globe, the association of log income with subjective well-being was linear but convex with raw income, indicating the declining marginal effects of income on subjective well-being. Income was a moderately strong predictor of life evaluation but a much weaker predictor of positive and negative feelings. Possessing luxury conveniences and satisfaction with standard of living were also strong predictors of life evaluation. Although the meeting of basic and psychological needs mediated the effects of income on life evaluation to some degree, the strongest mediation was provided by standard of living and ownership of conveniences. In contrast, feelings were most associated with the fulfillment of psychological needs: learning, autonomy, using one‚Äôs skills, respect, and the ability to count on others in an emergency. Thus, two separate types of prosperity‚Äî economic and social psychological‚Äî best predict different types of well-being.},

	abstract = {Background: The evaluation of interventions and policies designed to promote resilience, and research to understand the determinants and associations, require reliable and valid measures to ensure data quality. This paper systematically reviews the psychometric rigour of resilience measurement scales developed for use in general and clinical populations.
Methods: Eight electronic abstract databases and the internet were searched and reference lists of all identified papers were hand searched. The focus was to identify peer reviewed journal articles where resilience was a key focus and/or is assessed. Two authors independently extracted data and performed a quality assessment of the scale psychometric properties.
Results: Nineteen resilience measures were reviewed; four of these were refinements of the original measure. All the measures had some missing information regarding the psychometric properties. Overall, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, the Resilience Scale for Adults and the Brief Resilience Scale received the best psychometric ratings. The conceptual and theoretical adequacy of a number of the scales was questionable.
Conclusion: We found no current ‚Äògold standard‚Äô amongst 15 measures of resilience. A number of the scales are in the early stages of development, and all require further validation work. Given increasing interest in resilience from major international funders, key policy makers and practice, researchers are urged to report relevant validation statistics when using the measures.},

	abstract = {Recently, the disagreement that separates hedonic from eudaimonic philosophers has spread to the science of wellbeing. This has resulted in two opposing perspectives regarding both wellbeing concepts and proposed pathways to wellbeing. Whilst contention continues, most contemporary psychologists now agree that hedonic and eudaimonic approaches each denote important aspects of wellbeing. This has led to integrated wellbeing conceptualisations, in which the combined presence of hedonic and eudaimonic wellbeing components is referred to as ‚Äòflourishing‚Äô. In regard to the attainment of wellbeing, research simultaneously investigating hedonic and eudaimonic pathways suggests that a life rich in both types of pursuits is associated with the highest degree of wellbeing. Despite this assertion, previously underemphasised methodological limitations question the validity of such claims. To further progress this important area of investigation, future research directions to ameliorate said limitations are explored. It is recommended that the past tendency to contrast and compare hedonia and eudaimonia be abandoned, and instead that the inherent value of both be recognised. Time-use research methods are needed to cross-validate past findings obtained from cross-sectional research, which will make it possible to transition from purely descriptive conclusions to applied conclusions.},

The studies have important relations between humor and positive emotion as well as a significant improvement in signs and symptoms of depression using differents strategies of positive psychology. Another relevant aspect is the preventative character of the proposed interventions by positive psychology by the fact that increase well-being and produce elements such as resilience and coping resources that reduce the recurrent relapses in the treatment of depression. The strategies of positive psychology, such as increasing positive emotions, develop personal strengths: seeking direction, meaning and engagement for the day-to-day life of the patients, appear as potentially tools for the prophylaxis and treatment of depression, helping to reduce signs and symptoms as well as for prevention of relapses.},

Overall, results indicated that: between persons (at the trait level) and within persons (at the momentary state level), hedonic pursuits related more to positive affect and carefreeness, while eudaimonic pursuits related more to meaning; between persons, eudaimonia related more to elevating experience (awe, inspiration, and sense of connection with a greater whole); within persons, hedonia related more negatively to negative affect; between and within persons, both pursuits related equally to vitality; and both pursuits showed some links with life satisfaction, though hedonia‚Äôs links were more frequent. People whose lives were high in both eudaimonia and hedonia had: higher degrees of most well-being variables than people whose lives were low in both pursuits (but did not differ in negative affect or carefreeness); higher positive affect and carefreeness than predominantly eudaimonic individuals; and higher meaning, elevating experience, and vitality than predominantly hedonic individuals. In the intervention study, hedonia produced more well-being beneÔ¨Åts at short-term follow-up, while eudaimonia produced more at 3-month follow-up.

	abstract = {The epidemiology of flourishing is an important research topic prompting international interest in its psychometric assessment. But the need to measure human feelings and functioning at the population level has resulted in the creation of a multitude of different conceptual frameworks of flourishing: a term now commonly used to describe high levels of subjective wellbeing. Not only do different researchers theorise and conceptualise flourishing in different ways, but also the categorical diagnosis of flourishing is dependent upon the various combinations of components, and researcher-determined thresholds, used in each operationalization. The multiplicity of approaches is potentially limiting the usefulness of the resultant epidemiology. This paper comprises two parts: Part 1 identifies four operationalizations of flourishing in the psychology literature and reviews their psychometric properties and utility; Part 2 investigates the impact of operational definition on the prevalence of flourishing using the Sovereign Wellbeing Index survey, a sample of 10,009 adult New Zealanders, and reports substantial variation in prevalence rates according to the four different operationalizations: Huppert and So (24\%), Keyes (39\%), Diener et al. (41\%) and Seligman et al. (47\%). Huppert and So‚Äôs model was the only one of the four to require endorsement of one particular variable, making it the most stringent criterion for flourishing, while the other three were more flexible in their categorisation. Cross-tabulation analysis indicated strong agreement between our replications of Keyes and Seligman et al.‚Äôs models (81\%), and between Diener et al. and Seligman et al.‚Äôs models (80\%). Agreement between Seligman, and Huppert and So‚Äôs, operationalizations was moderate (74\%). Taken together, and in line with recent OECD recommendations, our findings reinforce the need for greater international collaboration and conceptualisation consensus when measuring flourishing. In the absence of any published empirical research investigating perceptions of flourishing among laypersons, a prototype analysis investigating alignment between lay and academic conceptualisations of flourishing is recommended.},

We hypothesized that need satisfaction is a mediator of the relationship between feelings of esteem for one‚Äôs community and several widely employed measures of wellbeing among a sample of residents living in an urban community in the United States. In accord with the primary hypotheses, the results revealed a robust association between community esteem and both hedonic and eudaimonic measures of wellbeing. Furthermore, the associations between community esteem and wellbeing were mediated by self-reported satisfaction of basic psychological needs. This work contributes to an improved understanding of the complex relationship between esteem for one‚Äôs community and psychological wellbeing and has implications for debates surrounding the benefits and role of community in individuals‚Äô lives.},

It sought to assess the impact of a number of demographic and other sociological and psychological factors, including physical and mental health, on emerging adults‚Äô outlook on life. This study also set out to validate and investigate the levels of wellbeing and character strengths in the context of a more collective, Mediterranean culture; that of Greece. Three hundred and twelve male and female students from two Greek Universities participated in the study, which consisted of a questionnaire battery, including measures of subjective wellbeing, character strengths and mental and physical health. Youths were found to have a positive outlook on life. Wisdom, courage and transcendence appeared to be the most salient among their character strengths, since character strengths were each highly and positively correlated with the wellbeing subscales of environmental mastery, purpose in life and self-acceptance. Good physical and mental health were positively related to, and reliably predicted different aspects of, both wellbeing and character strengths; nevertheless, mental health appeared to affect and predict more aspects of wellbeing and character strengths than physical health. The significance of the above findings for the field of positive psychology is discussed.},

The present study sought to explore the concept of ‚Äòflourishing‚Äô as it is constructed by students in British HE. An open-ended questionnaire was distributed to 222 students across two post-1992 (former polytechnic) British universities to elicit written qualitative data on their understandings of ‚Äòflourishing‚Äô and ‚Äòflourishing at university‚Äô, and of their characterisations of ‚Äòflourishing‚Äô and ‚Äònon-flourishing‚Äô students. Data was content analysed using an inductive approach. Prominent categories emerging from the data sets constructed ‚Äòflourishing‚Äô primarily as self-actualisation (personal growth, potential realisation) and success. However, engagement (both academic and social) emerged as a significant facet of ‚Äòflourishing at university‚Äô. The ‚Äòflourishing student‚Äô was characterised as academically and socially engaged, committed to learning, and oriented towards personal growth. Conversely, the ‚Äònon-flourishing‚Äô student emerged as having a general sense of lacking, a disengaged attitude towards academic work, and a lazy/withdrawn outlook. Results provide inductively derived support for four components of Wellbeing Theory ‚Äì positive emotions, engagement, relationships, and achievement (Seligman, 2011) and allow generic understandings of ‚Äòflourishing‚Äô to be contextualised within a HE setting. Further implications of the study and suggestions for future research are discussed with regard to the findings.},

Seven instruments were used to measure: Global Subjective Wellbeing; Satisfaction with Life in Domains; Positive and Negative State Affect; Positive and Negative Trait Affect; Standards of Comparison; Depression, Anxiety and Stress; Life Events; and SocioDemographic variables. Results indicated that Global SWB is predicted by Satisfaction with Life in Domains, and Positive and Negative State Affect. The cognitive dimension of SWB is predicted by Depression, Comparison Standards, State and Trait Affect, and several contextual variables. The affective dimension of SWB is predicted by Trait Affect, Depression, Anxiety, and the contextual variable of educational status. Results also indicated that intrapersonal variables are the main predictors of SWB, however contextual variables are also significant predictors. Each component of SWB (global, cognitive \& affective) shows different predictors, stressing the importance of analysing and reporting separately the results of each component.

This paper attempts to apply the combined cognitive bias hypothesis (Hirsch, Mathews, \& Clark, 2006) to depression research and reviews competing theoretical frameworks that have guided research in this area. We draw on current findings from behavioral studies on the interplay between depression-related processing biases. These data indicate that various cognitive biases are associated. However, it is not clear whether single or multiple biases are most predictive of depressive symptoms. We conclude this article with theoretical and clinical implications of the current state of research in this field and propose a number of ways in which research on the combined cognitive bias hypothesis can be advanced.},

A new affective task-switching paradigm that required participants to shift between categorizing positive and negative affective pictures according to emotional or nonemotional features was used to assess individual differences in affective flexibility. The results showed that greater affective flexibility (less switch costs) predicted the ability to use reappraisal to down-regulate emotions in response to a sad film clip. In particular, more efficient shifts toward the neutral aspects of negative pictures and toward the emotional aspects of positive pictures were found to predict reappraisal ability.

Impaired ability to switch from one thought to another might reÔ¨Çect difÔ¨Åculties in either generating new mental states, inhibiting previous states, or both. However, the neural underpinnings of impaired cognitive Ô¨Çexibility in mood disorders remain largely unresolved. We compared a group of mood disorders patients (n 5 29) and a group of matched healthy subjects (n 5 32) on a novel task-switching paradigm involving happy and sad faces, that allowed us to separate generation of a new mental set (Switch Cost) and inhibition of the previous set during switching (Inhibition Cost), using fMRI. Behavioral data showed a larger Switch Cost in patients relative to controls, but the average Inhibition Cost did not differ between groups. At the neural level, a main effect of group was found with stronger activation of the subgenual cingulate cortex in patients. The larger Switch Cost in patients was reÔ¨Çected by a stronger recruitment of brain regions involved in attention and executive control, including the left intraparietal sulcus, precuneus, left inferior fontal gyrus, and right anterior cingulate. Critically, activity in the subgenual cingulate cortex was not downregulated by inhibition in patients relative to controls. In conclusion, mood disorder patients have exaggerated Switch Cost relative to controls, and this deÔ¨Åcit in cognitive Ô¨Çexibility is associated with increased activation of the fronto-parietal attention networks, combined with impaired modulation of the subgenual cingulate cortex when inhibition of previous mental states is needed.

The present study sought to investigate internal cognitive control impairments related to emotional information and task settings in clinical depression (MDD, major depressive disorder). Internal cognitive control was operationalized as switching between internally held mental representations that required continuous updating in working memory and measured with the Internal Shift Task (IST). The results showed that MDD individuals were characterized by a general switching impairment. This switching impairment was neither inÔ¨Çuenced by the task-relevance of emotional information, nor inÔ¨Çuenced by the valence of the faces within the emotion condition. The impairment in cognitive control reÔ¨Çected in general switching impairments was related to rumination, a speciÔ¨Åc cognitive symptom and important risk factor of depression. The results of this study offer new insights into the relationship between depression and impaired cognitive control with potential clinical implications, informing treatment and prevention programmes.},

In the present study we tested the hypotheses that resilient people exhibit emotional flexibility: (a) in response to frequently changing emotional stimuli and (b) across multiple modalities of emotional responding. As participants viewed a series of emotional pictures, we assessed their self-reported affect, facial muscle activity, and startle reflexes. Higher trait resilience predicted more divergent affective and facial responses (corrugator and zygomatic) to positive versus negative pictures. Thus, compared with their low-resilient counterparts, resilient people appear to be able to more flexibly match their emotional responses to the frequently changing emotional stimuli. Moreover, whereas high-trait-resilient participants exhibited divergent startle responses to positive versus negative pictures regardless of the valence of the preceding trial, low-trait-resilient participants did not exhibit divergent startle responses when the preceding picture was negative. High-trait-resilient individuals, therefore, appear to be better able than are their low-resilient counterparts to either switch or maintain their emotional responses depending on whether the emotional context changes. The present findings broaden our understanding of the mechanisms underlying resilience by demonstrating that resilient people are able to flexibly change their affective and physiological responses to match the demands of frequently changing environmental circumstances.},

	abstract = {In this review of research concerning anxiety-linked attentional bias, we seek to illustrate a general principle that we contend applies across the breadth of experimental psychopathology. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we highlight how maintenance of a clear distinction between process and procedure serves to enhance the advancement of knowledge and understanding, while failure to maintain this distinction can foster confusion and misconception. We show how such clear differentiation has permitted the continuous reÔ¨Ånement of assessment procedures, in ways that have led to growing conÔ¨Ådence in the existence of the putative attentional bias process of interest, and also increasing understanding of its nature. In contrast, we show how a failure to consistently differentiate between process and procedure has contributed to confusion concerning whether or not attentional bias modiÔ¨Åcation reliably alters anxiety vulnerability and dysfunction. As we demonstrate, such confusion can be avoided by distinguishing the process of attentional bias modiÔ¨Åcation from the procedures that have been employed with the intention of evoking this target process. Such an approach reveals that procedures adopted with the intention of eliciting the attentional bias modiÔ¨Åcation process do not always do so, but that successful evocation of the attentional bias modiÔ¨Åcation process quite reliably alters anxiety symptomatology. We consider some of the speciÔ¨Åc implications for future research concerning attentional bias modiÔ¨Åcation, while also pointing to the broader implications for experimental psychopathology research in general.},

	abstract = {In recent years there has been growing interest in determining the attentional basis of positive affectivity. Investigators have sought to evaluate the hypothesis that elevated positive affectivity is characterized by an attentional bias that favours the processing of positive information over neutral information. Unfortunately, in the studies carried out to date, the assessment procedures used by researchers to assess such attentional selectivity have either been methodologically limited or methodologically Ô¨Çawed. Hence, the validity of the hypothesis has remained indeterminate. To overcome the problems associated with attentional assessment procedures used in previous studies, and so shed light on the attentional basis of positive affectivity, we employed an appropriate variant of the attentional probe task. Our Ô¨Åndings show that participants high in positive affectivity displayed greater relative attention to positive information compared to neutral information, than was the case for their low positive affectivity counterparts. Thus, the present results support the hypothesis that an attentional bias to positive information, relative to neutral information, is characteristic of elevated positive affectivity.},

Results revealed that the distant adversity group exhibited signiÔ¨Åcantly faster reaction times (RTs) than the no adversity and recent adversity only groups.

We used a performance-based measure to assess Ô¨Çuctuations in attentional broadening from self-related contrasted to not-self-related information. In Experiment 1, we checked that the selfrelated versus not-self-related stimuli did not evoke differential attention effects in general. In Experiment 2, we manipulated mood and found that an increase in positive mood was associated with a relative broadening of attention for self-related information.

	abstract = {The dot-probe task has been widely used in research to produce an index of biased attention based on reaction times (RTs). Despite its popularity, very few published studies have examined psychometric properties of the task, including test-retest reliability, and no previous study has examined reliability in clinically anxious samples or systematically explored the effects of task design and analysis decisions on reliability. In the current analysis, we utilized dot-probe data from three studies where attention bias towards threat-related faces was assessed at multiple (‚â•5) timepoints. Two of the studies were similar (adults with Social Anxiety Disorder, similar design features) while one was much more disparate (pediatric healthy volunteers, distinct task design). We explored the effects of analysis choices (e.g., bias score calculation formula, methods for outlier handling) on reliability and searched for convergence of findings across the three studies. We found that, when considering the three studies concurrently, the most reliable RT bias index utilized data from dot-bottom trials, comparing congruent to incongruent trials, with rescaled outliers, particularly after averaging across more than one assessment point. Although reliability of RT bias indices was moderate to low under most circumstances, within-session variability in bias (attention bias variability; ABV), a recently proposed RT index, was more reliable across sessions. Several eyetracking-based indices of attention bias (available in the pediatric healthy sample only) showed reliability that matched the optimal RT index (ABV). On the basis of these findings, we make specific recommendations to researchers using the dot probe, particularly those wishing to investigate individual differences and/or single-patient applications.},

Training yielded some improvement in performance on the numerosity-discrimination task, but only in older adolescents or adults. In contrast, training in relational reasoning improved performance on that task in all age groups, but training benefits were greater for people in late adolescence and adulthood than for people earlier in adolescence. Training did not increase performance on the face-perception task for any age group. Our findings suggest that for certain cognitive skills, training during late adolescence and adulthood yields greater improvement than training earlier in adolescence, which highlights the relevance of this late developmental stage for education.},

Reliability was assessed using split‚Äìhalf and test‚Äìretest correlations of mean reaction times (RTs), accuracy and bias indices. Convergence between measures was also examined. Mean RTs showed substantial split‚Äìhalf and test‚Äìretest correlations. Bias score reliability coefÔ¨Åcients were near zero and non-signiÔ¨Åcant, suggesting poor reliability in children of this age. Additionally, associations between bias scores and anxiety were weak and inconsistent and performance between tasks showed little convergence.

	abstract = {Cognitive models posit that social anxiety disorder (SAD) is associated with and maintained by biased attention allocation vis-√†-vis social threat. However, over the last decade, there has been intense debate regarding whether AB in SAD results from preferential engagement with or difÔ¨Åculty in disengaging from social threat. Further, recent evidence suggests that AB may merely result from top-down attentional impairments vis-√†-vis non-emotional material. Consequently, uncertainty still abounds regarding both the relative importance and the mutual interactions of these different processes and SAD symptoms. Inspired by novel network approaches to psychopathology that conceptualize symptoms as complex dynamic systems of mutually interacting variables, we computed weighted directed networks to investigate potential causal relations among laboratory measures of attentional components and symptoms of social anxiety disorder. Global and local connectivity of network structures revealed that the three most central variables were the orienting component of attention as well as both avoidance and fear of social situations. Neither preferential attention engagement with threat nor difÔ¨Åculty disengaging from threat exhibited high relative importance as predictors of symptoms in the network. Together, these Ô¨Åndings suggest the value of extending the network approach beyond self-reported clinical symptoms to incorporate process-level measures from laboratory tasks to gain new insight into the mechanisms of SAD.},

It has been suggested that this processing bias may play a functional role in mediating emotional vulnerability by moderating affective responses to stressful real life events. The current experiment employs a longitudinal design, capable of addressing the central predictions arising from this theoretical position. Thirty-one women awaiting colposcopy investigation were screened on both traditional questionnaire measures of emotional vulnerability, and on a modified emotional Stroop task that provided objective indices of their automatic and strategic patterns of processing selectivity. Subsequently, those 15 women who later received a diagnosis ofcer\&al pathology reported the degr\& to which this diagnosis had impaired their level of emotional functioning. The results confirm that, at the initial test time, Gait anxiety was indeed associated with an apparently automatic tendency to se.l\&tively process threat related distractor information. Furthermore, an index of this initial pattern of automatic processing selectivity was consistently the best predictor of the intensity of emotional distress elicited by the subsequent diagnosis of cervical pathology. None of our conventional questionnaire measures were capable of significantly predicting this later emotional response. We suggest that these findings offer empirical support for the hypotheses that patterns of automatic processing selectivity may moderate individuals‚Äô emotional responses to stressful life events.},

Probes always replaced the positive face, and subjects pushed a button to indicate the identity of the probe (E or F) as rapidly as possible. In the inverse condition, the probes always replaced the negative face, and in the control condition, the probes replaced each face type equally often. After four training sessions, all groups exhibited statistically indistinguishable, but signiÔ¨Åcant, reductions on self-report, behavioral, and physiological measures of speech anxiety. Self-report and behavioral measures of attentional control improved likewise. Contrary to early studies, ABM was not superior to control procedures in producing reductions on measures of social anxiety.},

Various measures have been developed to index these biases; unfortunately, the psychometric properties of response time measures of attentional bias have not been thoroughly evaluated, and the reliability of those that have been evaluated is poor. The current study assessed the reliability and convergent validity of dot probe and emotional cueing bias scores in high-anxious and low-anxious participants in the context of a state anxiety manipulation to increase the likelihood of producing large, potentially reliable attentional biases. One hundred sixty participants completed an anxious or calm mood induction followed by dot probe and emotional cueing tasks. Reliability estimates for bias scores in the full sample were low, ranging from 0 to .44; convergent validity estimates were also poor. The anxiety induction did not substantially improve the reliability or validity of the measures. These results underscore the importance of developing new, more reliable attentional bias measures for future research.},

Recent developments of the task have favoured the use of human faces as stimuli, however, results from this task have been inconsistent. In 2005, Schmukle published very poor reliability estimates for two versions of the dot-probe task using words and situational images as stimuli. The present study tested the reliability of two versions of the test, using photographs of human faces. One version was similar to previous research, while the other was a modification designed to meet a potential methodological issue. Results indicate that both versions tested were unreliable and therefore unsuitable for individual differences research. When considered as a group, however, participants showed consistent attentional bias towards emotional faces in the task similar to previous research, while habituation effects were found in the modified task. This suggests that the two tasks may be used in between-group designs to investigate different aspects of attention to emotional faces.},

The purpose of this study was to investigate the distinct features of worry and rumination in factor structure and their predictive validity for the diagnosis of GAD and MDD. Methods: Four hundred and sixty-eight patients with GAD (n = 148) and MDD (n = 320) were enrolled and the diagnoses were conÔ¨Årmed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Participants completed the Penn State Worry Questionnaire and Ruminative Response Scale and the severity of anxiety and depressive symptoms was assessed via clinician ratings. Results: In joint factor analysis using the Penn State Worry Questionnaire and Ruminative Response Scale items, worry and rumination emerged as distinct factors. In logistic regression analyses, worry contributed to a higher probability of the diagnosis of GAD than rumination, as rumination did in MDD than worry. Conclusion: This is the Ô¨Årst comprehensive study investigating the diagnostic utility of worry and rumination in a well-deÔ¨Åned clinical sample of both GAD and MDD. Our results suggest that worry and rumination are distinct cognitive processes and play a differential role in the diagnosis of GAD and MDD, distinguishing them at the cognitive level.},

Rumination has been found to mediate cross-sectional and prospective relations between anxiety and depressive symptoms in adolescents and adults. We examined whether rumination and worry, both forms of repetitive negative thinking, also explain the associations between affective disorders. This was studied using a prospective cohort study. In a mixed sample of 2981 adults (persons with a prior history of or a current affective disorder and healthy individuals) we assessed DSM-IV affective disorders (CIDI), rumination (LEIDS-R) and worry (PSWQ). All measures were repeated 2 years and 4 years later. Using structural equation models, we found that baseline rumination and worry partly mediated the association of baseline fear disorders (social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia) with distress disorders (dysthymia, major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder). Moreover, baseline fear disorders predicted changes in distress disorders and changes in worry and rumination mediated these associations. The association between baseline distress disorders and changes in fear disorders was mediated by changes in rumination but not by changes in worry. From these results it can be concluded that repetitive negative thinking is an important transdiagnostic factor. Rumination and worry are partly responsible for the cross-sectional and prospective co-occurrence of affective disorders and may be suitable targets for treatment.},

Results showed that higher depression levels were associated with slower disengagement from negative stimuli at baseline. As expected, the PT induced longer Ô¨Åxations on positive pictures and faster disengagement from negative pictures. The NT showed no changes in attentional processes.

A neurodevelopmental perspective on mindfulness has been advocated as a powerful tool to enhance our understanding of underlying neurocognitive changes that have implications for developmental well-being research and the implementation of mindfulness in education. To stimulate more research in the developmental cognitive neuroscience of mindfulness, this article outlines possible indexes of mindfulness-based change in adolescence, with a focus on event-related brain potential (ERP) markers. We provide methodological recommendations for future studies and offer examples of research paradigms. We also discuss how mindfulness practice could impact on the development of prefrontal brain structures and enhance attention control and emotion regulation skills in adolescents, impacting in turn on their self-regulation and coping skills. We highlight advantages of the ERP methodology in neurodevelopmental research of mindfulness. It is proposed that research using established experimental tasks targeting ERP components such as the contingent negative variability, N200, error-related negativity and error positivity, P300, and late positive potential could elucidate developmentally salient shifts in the neural plasticity of the adolescent brain induced by mindfulness practice.},

Results showed that load increased antisaccade latencies on trials where gaze toward face stimuli should be inhibited. This effect was exacerbated for high anxious individuals. Emotional expression also modulated task performance on antisaccade trials for both high and low anxious participants under low cognitive load, but did not inÔ¨Çuence performance under high load.

	abstract = {According to the predictions of attentional control theory (ACT) of anxiety (Eysenck, Derakshan, Santos, \& Calvo, 2007), worry is a central feature of anxiety that interferes with the ability to inhibit distracting information necessary for successful task performance. However, it is unclear how such cognitive control deficits are modulated by task demands and by the emotionality of the distractors. A sample of 31 participants (25 female) completed a novel flanker task with emotional and neutral distractors under lowand high-cognitive-load conditions. The negative-going N2 event-related potential was measured to index participants‚Äô level of top-down resource allocation in the inhibition of distractors under high- and low-load conditions. Results showed N2 amplitudes were larger under high- compared with low-load conditions. In addition, under high but not low load, trait worry was associated with greater N2 amplitudes. Our findings support ACT predictions that trait worry adversely affects goal-directed behavior, and is associated with greater recruitment of cognitive resources to inhibit the impact of distracting information under conditions in which cognitive resources are taxed.},

We tested this hypothesis in the current study by examining the causal inÔ¨Çuence of active worrying on WMC in a sample of undergraduate university students (n = 64) assigned either to a worry condition or to a non-worry control condition. Participants performed a change detection task before and after the worry/control manipulation. Mediation analyses showed that the level of self-reported worry mediated the effects of condition on change in WMC as demonstrated by the signiÔ¨Åcant indirect effect of worry and the resulting nonsigniÔ¨Åcant direct effect of condition on change in WMC. Similar results were obtained when using state anxiety measures as mediating factors.

Assessment included self-report questionnaires, as well as performance tasks measuring attentional control and working memory capacity. Combined training resulted in continued reduction in worry in the week after training, highlighting the potential of utilising n-back training as an adjunct to established clinical treatment. Engagement with WM training correlated with immediate improvements in attentional control and resilience, with worry decreasing over time.

The method established itself after the appearance of three seminal studies (Hess \& Polt, 1960, 1964; Kahneman \& Beatty, 1966). Since then, the method has continued to play a significant role within the field, and pupillary responses have been successfully used to provide an estimate of the ‚Äúintensity‚Äù of mental activity and of changes in mental states, particularly changes in the allocation of attention and the consolidation of perception. Remarkably, pupillary responses provide a continuous measure regardless of whether the participant is aware of such changes. More recently, research in neuroscience has revealed a tight correlation between the activity of the locus coeruleus (i.e., the ‚Äúhub‚Äù of the noradrenergic system) and pupillary dilation.As we discuss in this short review, these neurophysiological findings provide new important insights to the meaning of pupillary responses for mental activity. Finally, given that pupillary responses can be easily measured in a noninvasive manner, occur from birth, and can occur in the absence of voluntary, conscious processes, they constitute a very promising tool for the study of preverbal (e.g., infants) or nonverbal participants (e.g., animals, neurological patients).},

	abstract = {This is the first study to examine attentional control capacities in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). GAD is characterized by uncontrollable worry. Individuals diagnosed with GAD and healthy participants (HPs) performed a random key-pressing task while thinking about a worrisome or a positive future event, to assess the extent to which attentional control resources are used by worry. Attentional control was also assessed when participants were not instructed to think about a specific topic using the N-back task, which varies in task difficulty, and therefore is sensitive to subtle differences in ability to handle increasing demands on attentional control within the same paradigm. GAD participants (but not HPs) were less random while worrying than thinking about a positive event during the key-pressing task, suggesting that worry consumed more attentional control resources in this population. During the N-Back task, GAD participants performed worse than HPs during the high load conditions only, indicating greater difficulty in sustaining focus on conditions requiring a higher degree of attentional control, even without concurrent task activity. Poor attentional control might underpin the difficulty of GAD individuals to stop worrying and switch to thinking more benign information. Further research could investigate whether worry consumes attentional control resources in other psychological disorders with high rates of worry (e.g., panic disorder, psychosis), as well as the extent to which attentional control is used by other forms of repetitive thinking, such as depressive rumination.},

	abstract = {Background: Meta-analyses play an important role in cumulative science by combining information across multiple studies and attempting to provide effect size estimates corrected for publication bias. Research on the reproducibility of meta-analyses reveals that errors are common, and the percentage of effect size calculations that cannot be reproduced is much higher than is desirable. Furthermore, the flexibility in inclusion criteria when performing a meta-analysis, combined with the many conflicting conclusions drawn by meta-analyses of the same set of studies performed by different researchers, has led some people to doubt whether meta-analyses can provide objective conclusions. Discussion: The present article highlights the need to improve the reproducibility of meta-analyses to facilitate the identification of errors, allow researchers to examine the impact of subjective choices such as inclusion criteria, and update the meta-analysis after several years. Reproducibility can be improved by applying standardized reporting guidelines and sharing all meta-analytic data underlying the meta-analysis, including quotes from articles to specify how effect sizes were calculated. Pre-registration of the research protocol (which can be peer-reviewed using novel ‚Äòregistered report‚Äô formats) can be used to distinguish a-priori analysis plans from data-driven choices, and reduce the amount of criticism after the results are known. Summary: The recommendations put forward in this article aim to improve the reproducibility of meta-analyses. In addition, they have the benefit of ‚Äúfuture-proofing‚Äù meta-analyses by allowing the shared data to be re-analyzed as new theoretical viewpoints emerge or as novel statistical techniques are developed. Adoption of these practices will lead to increased credibility of meta-analytic conclusions, and facilitate cumulative scientific knowledge.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the network approach to psychopathology has been advanced as an alternative way of conceptualizing mental disorders. In this approach, mental disorders arise from direct interactions between symptoms. Although the network approach has led to many novel methodologies and substantive applications, it has not yet been fully articulated as a scientiÔ¨Åc theory of mental disorders. The present paper aims to develop such a theory, by postulating a limited set of theoretical principles regarding the structure and dynamics of symptom networks. At the heart of the theory lies the notion that symptoms of psychopathology are causally connected through myriads of biological, psychological and societal mechanisms. If these causal relations are sufÔ¨Åciently strong, symptoms can generate a level of feedback that renders them self-sustaining. In this case, the network can get stuck in a disorder state. The network theory holds that this is a general feature of mental disorders, which can therefore be understood as alternative stable states of strongly connected symptom networks. This idea naturally leads to a comprehensive model of psychopathology, encompassing a common explanatory model for mental disorders, as well as novel deÔ¨Ånitions of associated concepts such as mental health, resilience, vulnerability and liability. In addition, the network theory has direct implications for how to understand diagnosis and treatment, and suggests a clear agenda for future research in psychiatry and associated disciplines.},

	abstract = {The usage of psychological networks that conceptualize behaviour as a complex interplay of psychological and other components has gained increasing popularity in various research Ô¨Åelds. While prior publications have tackled the topics of estimating and interpreting such networks, little work has been conducted to check how accurate (i.e., prone to sampling variation) networks are estimated, and how stable (i.e., interpretation remains similar with less observations) inferences from the network structure (such as centrality indices) are. In this tutorial paper, we aim to introduce the reader to this Ô¨Åeld and tackle the problem of accuracy under sampling variation. We Ô¨Årst introduce the current state-of-the-art of network estimation. Second, we provide a rationale why researchers should investigate the accuracy of psychological networks. Third, we describe how bootstrap routines can be used to (A) assess the accuracy of estimated network connections, (B) investigate the stability of centrality indices, and (C) test whether network connections and centrality estimates for diÔ¨Äerent variables diÔ¨Äer from each other. We introduce two novel statistical methods: for (B) the correlation stability coeÔ¨Écient, and for (C) the bootstrapped diÔ¨Äerence test for edge-weights and centrality indices. We conducted and present simulation studies to assess the performance of both methods. Finally, we developed the free R-package bootnet that allows for estimating psychological networks in a generalized framework in addition to the proposed bootstrap methods. We showcase bootnet in a tutorial, accompanied by R syntax, in which we analyze a dataset of 359 women with posttraumatic stress disorder available online.},

Methods: Participants (N ¬º 251, 83.7\% female) showing elevated levels of RNT were randomly allocated to a 6-week cognitive-behavioral training delivered in a group, via the internet, or to a waitlist control condition. Self-report measures were collected at pre-intervention, post-intervention, 3 m and 12 m follow-up.
Results: Both versions of the preventive intervention signiÔ¨Åcantly reduced RNT (d ¬º 0.53 to 0.89), and symptom levels of anxiety and depression (d ¬º 0.36 to 0.72). Effects were maintained until 12 m followup. The interventions resulted in a signiÔ¨Åcantly lower 12 m prevalence rate of depression (group intervention: 15.3\%, internet intervention: 14.7\%) and generalized anxiety disorder (group intervention: 18.0\%, internet intervention: 16.0\%), compared to the waitlist (32.4\% and 42.2\%, respectively). Mediation analyses demonstrated that reductions in RNT mediated the effect of the interventions on the prevalence of depression and generalized anxiety disorder.
Conclusions: Results provide evidence for the efÔ¨Åcacy of this preventive intervention targeting RNT and support a selective prevention approach that speciÔ¨Åcally targets a known risk factor to prevent multiple disorders. ¬© 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The goal of the present investigation was to examine an overlooked consequence of this liability with respect to replication, when such implicit measures are used as dependent variables in experimental studies. Using a Monte Carlo simulation, the authors demonstrate that a higher level of unreliability in such dependent variables is associated with substantially lower levels of replicability. The results imply that this overlooked consequence can have farreaching repercussions for the development of a cumulative science.

	abstract = {Behavioral medicine research often seeks to examine relatively complex theoretical models and clinical processes. Traditional designs, based on retrospective self-report in the natural environment or laboratory-based studies, cannot assess complex and temporally dynamic psychological, behavioral, and physiological processes in the natural environment. An alternate research approach, Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), provides a method to collect such data. This research approach and these data allow investigation of a number of research questions not amenable to other data collection methods. Examples of research questions uniquely suited for EMA data include, but are not limited to: (1) the comparison of retrospective data to momentary data; (2) evaluation of physiological and psychosocial processes in the natural environment; (3) the relation of symptoms and other disease processes to characteristics of the natural environment; and (4) examination of dynamic changes in psychosocial variables that may mediate improvement following treatment. Despite the strengths of EMA data, a number of challenges exist ‚Äìincluding logistic, analytic, and interpretation problems ‚Äì to the easy implementation of EMA approaches in behavioral medicine.},

	abstract = {Studies incorporating repeated observations of momentary phenomena are becoming more common in behavioral and medical science.Analysis of such data requires the use of statistical techniques that are unfamiliar to many investigators. Some common ways of analyzing momentary data are reviewed---aggregation strategies, repeated measures analysis of variance, pooled within-person regression, and two-stage estimation procedures for multilevel models---and are found to be usually suboptimal, possibly leading to incorrect inferences. A broad class of statistical models for multilevel data that can address many research questions typically asked of momentary data are then described. Analytic issues that merit careful consideration include the scaling of momentary variables, allowance for serial autocorrelation of residuals, and the treatment of coefficients that vary across individuals as fixed versus random effects.},

When threat cues signal dangers that can be mitigated through behavioural action, vigilance for these threat cues can have an adaptive function. It is unknown, however, whether the anxiety-linked attentional bias is maintained or eliminated in contexts where threat cues signal dangers that can be mitigated. The current study used a probe task to assess anxiety-linked attentional bias to threat cues signalling a danger (noise burst) that in one condition could and in another condition could not be mitigated. Results showed that high trait anxious participants exhibited a larger attentional bias to threat than low trait anxious participants, and importantly, this anxiety-linked attentional bias did not differ as a function of danger mitigability. These findings suggest that anxiety-linked attentional bias is a rather pervasive processing style that may be insensitive to contextual variation in the adaptiveness of attending to threat.},

In this tutorial, we introduce the reader to estimating the most popularly used network model for psychological data: the partial correlation network. We describe how regularization techniques can be used to eÔ¨Éciently estimate a parsimonious and interpretable network structure on cross-sectional data. We show how to perform these analyses in R and demonstrate the method in an empirical example on post-traumatic stress disorder data. In addition, we discuss the eÔ¨Äect of the hyperparameter that needs to be manually set by the researcher, how to handle non-normal data, how to investigate the required sample size for a network analysis and provide a checklist with potential solutions for problems often arise when estimating regularized partial correlation networks.},

Yet a radically different approach to conceptualizing psychopathology promises to advance our understanding, thereby complementing traditional laboratory experiments. In contrast to viewing symptoms as reÔ¨Çective of underlying, latent categories or dimensions, network analysis conceptualizes symptoms as constitutive of mental disorders, not reÔ¨Çective of them. Disorders emerge from the causal interactions among symptoms themselves, and intervening on central symptoms in disorder networks promises to foster rapid recovery. One purpose of this article is to contrast network analysis with traditional approaches, and consider its strengths and limitations. A second purpose is to review novel computational methods that may enable researchers to discern the causal structure of disorders (e.g., Bayesian networks).

	abstract = {Background: Daughters of depressed mothers are at increased risk for developing a depressive disorder. We know relatively little, however, about the speciÔ¨Åc factors that contribute to this elevated risk. The present study investigated the effects of familial risk for depression and the 5-HTTLPR and COMT Val158Met polymorphisms, which have been associated with risk for depression, on biases in endorsement of and memory for positive and negative adjectives.
Methods: Following a negative mood induction, 60 girls between the ages of 10 and 14 who had recurrent depressed mothers (high risk for depression) and 91 age-matched daughters of neverdisordered mothers (low risk for depression) completed a Self-Referent Encoding Task in which they decided whether negative and positive adjectives described them. Following the task they were asked to recall as many of the adjectives as they could.
Results: Despite the absence of signiÔ¨Åcant group differences in endorsement of positive or negative adjectives, high-risk girls with the COMT Val158Met Val/Val polymorphism recalled more positive (but not negative) words that they had endorsed than did high-risk girls who were homozygous for the Met allele. COMT was not associated with recall of valenced adjectives in low-risk girls. Across risk groups, 5-HTTLPR polymorphism was not associated with recall of valenced adjectives. Limitations: Even with over 150 participants, there were relatively small numbers in some of the cells of this study, limiting its statistical power.
Conclusions: These results suggest that assessing the interaction of familial risk status and COMT polymorphism is important in understanding the development of depressive disorders. \& 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This study aimed to extend research on interpretation bias to an adolescent population.

Results showed that negative interpretations of social situations were more common in the high anxious than control group. Such negative bias could not be accounted for by high levels of negative affect. The groups did not differ as to their positive interpretations. Furthermore, there was evidence for content speciÔ¨Åcity of interpretation bias; high anxious adolescents were not more negative than control participants in their interpretations of non-social situations.

For instance, a correlation matrix can be represented as a network in which each variable is a node and each correlation an edge; by varying the width of the edges according to the magnitude of the correlation, the structure of the correlation matrix can be visualized. A wide variety of matrices that are used in statistics can be represented in this fashion, for example matrices that contain (implied) covariances, factor loadings, regression parameters and p values. qgraph can also be used as a psychometric tool, as it performs exploratory and conÔ¨Årmatory factor analysis, using sem and lavaan; the output of these packages is automatically visualized in qgraph, which may aid the interpretation of results. In this article, we introduce qgraph by applying the package functions to data from the NEO-PI-R, a widely used personality questionnaire.},

	abstract = {Persistent complex bereavement disorder (PCBD) is a bereavement-specific syndrome characterized by prolonged and impairing grief. Most research on this syndrome rests on the traditional latent variable model whereby symptoms reflect an underlying entity. The network (or causal system) approach offers an alternative framework for understanding PCBD that does not suffer from limitations inherent in the latent entity approach. The network approach to psychopathology conceptualizes the relation between symptoms and disorder as mereological, not reflective. That is, symptoms do not reflect an inferred, unobservable category or dimension, but rather are themselves constitutive of the disorder. Accordingly, we propose that PCBD constitutes a causal system of mutually reinforcing symptoms that arise following the death of a loved one and settle into a pathological equilibrium. In this study, we used data from the Changing Lives of Older Couples (CLOC) database to identify symptoms central to PCBD, distinguish the PCBD network from an overlapping but distinct network of depression symptoms, and examine how previously identified risk factors may contribute to the maintenance or development of PCBD. Together, these findings provide an important first step toward understanding the nature and etiology of the PCBD network.},

The past years have resulted in over 40 scientific publications and numerous conference symposia and workshops. Now is an excellent moment to take stock of the network approach: what are its most fundamental challenges, and what are potential ways forward in addressing them? After a brief conceptual introduction, we first discuss challenges to network theory: (1) What is the validity of the network approach beyond some commonly investigated disorders such as major depression? (2) How do we best define psychopathological networks and their constituent elements? (3) And how can we gain a better understanding of the causal nature and real-life underpinnings of associations among symptoms? Next, after a short technical introduction to network modeling, we discuss challenges to network methodology: (4) Heterogeneity of samples studied with network analytic models; and (5) a lurking replicability crisis in this strongly data-driven and exploratory field. Addressing these challenges may propel the network approach from its adolescence into adulthood, and promises advances in understanding psychopathology both at the nomothetic and idiographic level.},

	abstract = {Background New indices, calculated on data from the widely used Dot Probe Task, were recently proposed to capture variability in biased attention allocation. We observed that it remains unclear which data pattern is meant to be indicative of dynamic bias and thus to be captured by these indices. Moreover, we hypothesized that the new indices are sensitive to SD differences at the response time (RT) level in the absence of bias.
Method Randomly generated datasets were analyzed to assess properties of the Attention Bias Variability (ABV) and Trial Level Bias Score (TL-BS) indices. Sensitivity to creating differences in 1) RT standard deviation, 2) mean RT, and 3) bias magnitude were assessed. In addition, two possible definitions of dynamic attention bias were explored by creating differences in 4) frequency of bias switching, and 5) bias magnitude in the presence of constant switching.
Results ABV and TL-BS indices were found highly sensitive to increasing SD at the response time level, insensitive to increasing bias, linearly sensitive to increasing bias magnitude in the presence of bias switches, and non-linearly sensitive to increasing the frequency of bias switches. The ABV index was also found responsive to increasing mean response times in the absence of bias.
Conclusion Recently proposed DPT derived variability indices cannot uncouple measurement error from bias variability. Significant group differences may be observed even if there is no bias present in any individual dataset. This renders the new indices in their current form unfit for empirical purposes. Our discussion focuses on fostering debate and ideas for new research to validate the potentially very important notion of biased attention being dynamic.},

	abstract = {The dot-probe task is often considered a gold standard in the Ô¨Åeld for investigating attentional bias to threat. However, serious issues with the task have been raised. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, a number of studies have demonstrated that the traditional reaction time (RT) measure of attentional bias to threat in the dot-probe task has poor internal reliability and poor test-retest reliability. In addition, although threatening stimuli capture attention in other paradigms, attentional bias to threat has not usually been found in typical research participants in the dot-probe task. However, when attention is measured in the dotprobe task with the N2pc component of the event-related potential waveform, substantial attentional orienting to threat is observed, and the internal reliability is moderate. To provide a rigorous comparison of the reliability of this N2pc measure and the conventional behavioral measure, as well as to examine the relationship of these measures to anxiety, the present study examined the N2pc in conjunction with RT in the dot-probe task in a large sample of participants (N = 96). As in previous studies, RT showed no bias to threatening images across the sample and exhibited poor internal reliability. Moreover, this measure did not relate to trait anxiety. By contrast, the N2pc revealed a signiÔ¨Åcant initial shift of attention to threat, and this measure was internally reliable. However, the N2pc was not correlated with trait anxiety, indicating that it does not provide a meaningful index of individual differences in anxiety in the dot-probe task. Together, these results indicate a serious need to develop new tasks and methods to more reliably investigate attentional bias to threat and its relationship to anxiety in both clinical and non-clinical populations.},

	abstract = {Background and objectives: Attentional bias modiÔ¨Åcation (ABM) is a potentially exciting new development in the treatment of anxiety disorders. However, reported therapeutic beneÔ¨Åts have not always been replicated. To gauge the sensitivity of tasks used in ABM treatment and assessment, we used a counterbalanced within-subject design to measure their discriminant sensitivity to neutral and threatening facial expressions, comparing them with other well-known tasks that measure visual attention.
Methods: We compared two tasks often used in the assessment and treatment of attention bias (the dotprobe and the spatial cueing paradigms) with two well-known visual attention tasks (the irrelevant singleton and attentional blink paradigms), measuring their sensitivity to processing differences between threatening and neutral expressions for non-clinical observers.
Results: The dot-probe, spatial cueing and irrelevant singleton paradigms showed little or no sensitivity to processing differences between facial expressions while the attentional blink task proved very sensitive to such differences. Furthermore, the attentional blink task provided an intriguing picture of the temporal dynamics of attentional biases that the other paradigms cannot do. Limitations: These results need to be replicated with larger samples, including a comparison of a group of individuals diagnosed with social anxiety disorder and normal controls.
Conclusions: Our results indicate that the sensitivity of putative attentional bias measures should be assessed experimentally for more powerful assessment and treatment of such biases. If the attentional blink task is indeed particularly sensitive to attentional biases, as our Ô¨Åndings indicate, it is not unreasonable to expect that interventions based on this task may be more effective than those based on the tasks that are currently used.},

Various measures have been developed to index these biases; unfortunately, the psychometric properties of response time measures of attentional bias have not been thoroughly evaluated, and the reliability of those that have been evaluated is poor. The current study assessed the reliability and convergent validity of dot probe and emotional cueing bias scores in high-anxious and low-anxious participants in the context of a state anxiety manipulation to increase the likelihood of producing large, potentially reliable attentional biases. One hundred sixty participants completed an anxious or calm mood induction followed by dot probe and emotional cueing tasks. Reliability estimates for bias scores in the full sample were low, ranging from 0 to .44; convergent validity estimates were also poor. The anxiety induction did not substantially improve the reliability or validity of the measures.

In an Ising model, the full conditional distributions of each variable form logistic regression models, and variable selection techniques for regression allow one to identify the neighborhood of each node and, thus, the entire graph. We prove highdimensional consistency results for this pseudo-likelihood approach to graph selection when using Bayesian information criteria for the variable selection problems in the logistic regressions. The results pertain to scenarios of sparsity, and following related prior work the information criteria we consider incorporate an explicit prior that encourages sparsity.},

	abstract = {Gaussian graphical models with sparsity in the inverse covariance matrix are of signiÔ¨Åcant interest in many modern applications. For the problem of recovering the graphical structure, information criteria provide useful optimization objectives for algorithms searching through sets of graphs or for selection of tuning parameters of other methods such as the graphical lasso, which is a likelihood penalization technique. In this paper we establish the consistency of an extended Bayesian information criterion for Gaussian graphical models in a scenario where both the number of variables p and the sample size n grow. Compared to earlier work on the regression case, our treatment allows for growth in the number of non-zero parameters in the true model, which is necessary in order to cover connected graphs. We demonstrate the performance of this criterion on simulated data when used in conjunction with the graphical lasso, and verify that the criterion indeed performs better than either cross-validation or the ordinary Bayesian information criterion when p and the number of non-zero parameters q both scale with n.},

Furthermore, we show how networks can be simultaneously estimated in separate groups of individuals, using a technique called the Fused Graphical Lasso. This technique allows also performing meaningful comparisons among groups. The unique properties of each kind of network are discussed.

As many patients do not beneÔ¨Åt from e or have difÔ¨Åculties accessing e frontline treatments, novel, effective and easy-to-deliver interventions are needed. Cognitive Bias ModiÔ¨Åcation of Interpretations (CBM-I) training has been used to treat adult anxiety disorders. CBM-I methods train individuals to endorse benign rather than negative resolutions of ambiguous cues. Developmental extensions of CBM-I are important for several reasons. First, implementing CBM-I in symptomatic children and adolescents may facilitate early preventative gains. Second, as training uses simple learning mechanisms, CBM-I may reÔ¨Çect a developmentallysuitable strategy for shaping adaptive processing styles. Third, as this age range involves protracted neurocognitive maturation and associated plasticity, administering CBM-I early could drive powerful, long-lasting beneÔ¨Åts for emotional development. Finally, data from CBM-I studies could inform the cognitive mechanisms involved in the genesis of early-emerging anxiety. This paper provides the Ô¨Årst organised review of CBM-I studies conducted in children and adolescents, and contains suggestions for future research that may help realise the therapeutic potential of early CBM-I interventions.},

Although data consistently show it is associated with self-reported negative cognitive styles, less is known about the mechanisms underlying this relationship. Cognitive biases in attention, interpretation and memory represent plausible mechanisms and are known to characterise adult depression. We provide the Ô¨Årst structured review of studies investigating the nature and causal role of cognitive biases in youth depression. Key questions are (i) do cognitive biases characterise youth depression? (ii) are cognitive biases a vulnerability factor for youth depression? and (iii) do cognitive biases play a causal role in youth depression? We Ô¨Ånd consistent evidence for positive associations between attention and interpretation biases and youth depression. Stronger biases in youth with an elevated risk of depression support cognitive-vulnerability models. Preliminary evidence from cognitive bias modiÔ¨Åcation paradigms supports a causal role of attention and interpretation biases in youth depression but these paradigms require testing in clinical samples before they can be considered treatment tools. Studies of memory biases in youth samples have produced mixed Ô¨Åndings and none have investigated the causal role of memory bias.

	abstract = {Background. Structural models of emotional disorders propose that anxiety disorders can be classiÔ¨Åed into fear and distress disorders. Sources of evidence for this distinction come from genetic, self-report and neurophysiological data from adults. The present study examined whether this distinction relates to cognitive processes, indexed by attention bias towards threat, which is thought to cause and maintain anxiety disorders.
Method. Diagnostic and attention bias data were analysed from 435 children between 5 and 13 years of age; 158 had principal fear disorder (speciÔ¨Åc phobia, social phobia or separation anxiety disorder), 75 had principal distress disorder (generalized anxiety disorder, GAD) and 202 had no psychiatric disorder. Anxious children were a clinic-based treatment-seeking sample. Attention bias was assessed on a visual-probe task with angry, neutral and happy faces.
Results. Compared to healthy controls, children with principal distress disorder (GAD) showed a signiÔ¨Åcant bias towards threat relative to neutral faces whereas children with principal fear disorder showed an attention bias away from threat relative to neutral faces. Overall, children displayed an attention bias towards happy faces, irrespective of diagnostic group.
Conclusions. Our Ô¨Åndings support the distinction between fear and distress disorders, and extend empirically derived structural models of emotional disorders to threat processing in childhood, when many anxiety disorders begin and predict lifetime impairment.},

Although several general reviews of the ANT exist, none provide an analysis of its psychometric properties. Method: Data from 15 unique studies were collected, resulting in a large sample (N œ≠ 1,129) of healthy individuals. Split-half reliability, variance structure, distribution shape, and independence of measurement of the 3 attention network scores were analyzed, considering both reaction time and accuracy as dependent variables. Results: Split-half reliabilities of reaction time based attention network scores were low for alerting (rweighted œ≠ .20, CI 95\%weighted [.14, .27], Spearman‚ÄìBrown r œ≠ .38) and orienting (rweighted œ≠ .32, CI 95\%weighted [.26, .38], Spearman‚ÄìBrown r œ≠ .55), and moderate high for executive control (rweighted œ≠ .65, CI 95\%weighted [.61, .71], Spearman‚ÄìBrown r œ≠ .81). Analysis of the variance structure of the ANT indicated that power to Ô¨Ånd signiÔ¨Åcant effects was variable across networks and dependent on the statistical analysis being used. Both analysis of variance (signiÔ¨Åcant interaction observed in 100\% of 15 studies) and correlational analyses (multiplesigniÔ¨Åcant inter-network correlations observed) suggest that the networks measured by the ANT are not independent. Conclusions: In the collection, analysis and interpretation of any test data, psychometric properties, such as those reported here for the ANT, must be carefully considered.},

At the core of their account is the idea that reliability can be equated with statistical power, such that ‚Äúlower levels of reliability are associated with decreasing probabilities of detecting a statistically signiÔ¨Åcant effect, given one exists in the population‚Äù (p. 573). They also take the additional step of equating reliability and replicability. In our commentary, we draw attention to the fact that there is no direct, Ô¨Åxed or one-to-one relation between reliability and power or replicability.

In this review, we investigate to what extent these causal claims are supported by sound empirical evidence. Although differences in attentional bias are associated with differences in fear and anxiety, this association does not emerge consistently. Moreover, there is only limited evidence that individual differences in attentional bias are related to individual differences in fear or anxiety. In line with a causal relation, some studies show that attentional bias precedes fear or anxiety in time. However, other studies show that fear and anxiety can precede the onset of attentional bias, suggesting circular or reciprocal causality. Importantly, a recent line of experimental research shows that changes in attentional bias can lead to changes in anxiety. Yet changes in fear and anxiety also lead to changes in attentional bias, which confirms that the relation between attentional bias and fear and anxiety is unlikely to be unidirectional. Finally, a similar causal relation between interpretation bias and anxiety has been documented. In sum, there is evidence in favor of causality, yet a strict unidirectional cause‚Äì effect model is unlikely to hold. The relation between attentional bias and fear and anxiety is best described as a bidirectional, maintaining, or mutually reinforcing relation.},

	abstract = {Objective: Heightened trait anxiety is associated with impaired behavioural preparedness for natural hazards. However, little is known about the mechanisms that contribute to this association. Research has shown that trait anxiety is associated with an attentional bias (AB) towards threat-relevant information, and some researchers have suggested that such vigilance could exacerbate the detrimental effect of trait anxiety on behavioural preparedness. Conversely, given the potentially adaptive role of AB in promoting engagement in danger mitigation behaviour, it is also possible that AB could ameliorate the negative association between anxiety and preparedness. The aim of this study was to discriminate the validity of these two hypotheses. Method: Participants were recruited from a bushÔ¨Åre-prone community in Western Australia and were assessed on measures of trait anxiety, AB to threat, and current bushÔ¨Åre preparedness. Results: As predicted, the results showed a negative correlation between trait anxiety and bushÔ¨Åre preparedness, and a positive correlation between trait anxiety and AB to bushÔ¨Åre-related threat. Furthermore, the negative relationship between trait anxiety and preparedness was moderated by this AB to bushÔ¨Åre-related threat, with the direction of this moderation showing that AB further exacerbated this negative relationship. Conclusions: This study is the Ô¨Årst to show that in a situation where people are exposed to a real-world danger that can be mitigated through appropriate engagement in speciÔ¨Åc preparatory behaviours, AB to danger-relevant threat serves to strengthen the observed negative association between trait anxiety and behavioural preparedness. Implications of these Ô¨Åndings are discussed.},

Elevated inÔ¨Çammation, a common risk factor across diseases of aging, may play a key role in the relationship between anxiety and physical disease. However, the neurobiological mechanisms linking anxiety with elevated inÔ¨Çammation remain unclear. In this review, we present a neurobiological model of the mechanisms by which anxiety promotes inÔ¨Çammation. SpeciÔ¨Åcally we propose that exaggerated neurobiological sensitivity to threat in anxious individuals may lead to sustained threat perception, which is accompanied by prolonged activation of threat-related neural circuitry and threat-responsive biological systems including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, autonomic nervous system (ANS), and inÔ¨Çammatory response. Over time, this pattern of responding can promote chronic inÔ¨Çammation through structural and functional brain changes, altered sensitivity of immune cell receptors, dysregulation of the HPA axis and ANS, and accelerated cellular aging. Chronic inÔ¨Çammation, in turn, increases risk for diseases of aging. Exaggerated neurobiological sensitivity to threat may thus be a treatment target for reducing disease risk in anxious individuals.},

The second experiment provided additional evidence that the incongruency effect reflects a global shift in affective attentional biases and is not mediated by changes in strategies or in the perceived valence of the stimuli.

It is a core process in the choice of speciÔ¨Åc defenses, such as Ô¨Çight, freezing, defensive threat and defensive attack, that counter the threat and minimize the danger it poses. This highly adaptive process takes into account important characteristics, such as type and location (including distance from the subject) of the threat, as well as those (e.g. presence of an escape route or hiding place) of the situation, combining them to predict which speciÔ¨Åc defense is optimal with that particular combination of threat and situation. Risk assessment is particularly associated with ambiguity either of the threat stimulus or of the outcome of available defensive behaviors. It is also crucial in determining that threat is no longer present, permitting a return to normal, nondefensive behavior. Although risk assessment has been described in detail in rodents, it is also a feature of human defensive behavior, particularly in association with ambiguity. Rumination may be a speciÔ¨Åcally human form of risk assessment, more often expressed by women, and highly associated with anxiety.},

The current paper draws on theoretical frameworks and key empirical studies to outline the distinctive attentional processes highlighted as being important in understanding anxiety. We develop a conceptual framework to make a distinction between two attentional biases: selective attention to threat and hypervigilance for threat. We suggest that these biases each have a different purpose and can account for the typical patterns of facilitated and impaired attention evident in anxious individuals. The framework is novel in its speciÔ¨Åcation of the eye movement behavior associated with these attentional biases. We highlight that selective attention involves narrowing overt attention onto threat to ensure that these stimuli receive processing priority, leading to rapid engagement with task-relevant threat and delayed disengagement from task-irrelevant threat. We show that hypervigilance operates in the presence and absence of threat and involves monitoring for potential dangers via attentional broadening or excessive scanning of the environment with numerous eye movements, leading to improved threat detection and increased distraction from task-irrelevant threat. We conclude that future research could usefully employ eye movement measures to more clearly understand the diverse roles of attention in anxiety.},

Attention and interpretation biases were significantly correlated with anxiety. Mixed results were reported with regard to depression: evidence was found for an interpretation bias, and for an attention bias as measured with the EVST but not with the DPT. Furthermore, interpretation and attention biases predicted unique variance in anxiety and depression scores. These results indicate that attention and interpretation biases are unique processes in anxiety and depression. They also suggest that anxiety and depression are partly based on similar underlying cognitive mechanisms.},

This article provides an applied introduction to Bayesian inference with Bayes factors using JASP. First, we provide a brief background outlining Bayesian inference. We then use JASP to demonstrate Bayesian alternatives for common classical null hypothesis signiÔ¨Åcance tests. While Bayesian analysis is by no means a new method, this type of statistical inference has been largely inaccessible for most psychiatry researchers. JASP provides a straightforward means of performing Bayesian analysis using a graphical ‚Äúpoint and click‚Äù environment that will be familiar to researchers conversant with other graphical statistical packages, such as SPSS.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12966-015-0162-z},
	abstract = {Background: According to the CONSORT statement, significance testing of baseline differences in randomized controlled trials should not be performed. In fact, this practice has been discouraged by numerous authors throughout the last forty years. During that time span, reporting of baseline differences has substantially decreased in the leading general medical journals. Our own experience in the field of nutrition behavior research however, is that co-authors, reviewers and even editors are still very persistent in their demand for these tests. The aim of this paper is therefore to negate this demand by providing clear evidence as to why testing for baseline differences between intervention groups statistically is superfluous and why such results should not be published. Discussion: Testing for baseline differences is often propagated because of the belief that it shows whether randomization was successful and it identifies real or important differences between treatment arms that should be accounted for in the statistical analyses. Especially the latter argument is flawed, because it ignores the fact that the prognostic strength of a variable is also important when the interest is in adjustment for confounding. In addition, including prognostic variables as covariates can increase the precision of the effect estimate. This means that choosing covariates based on significance tests for baseline differences might lead to omissions of important covariates and, less importantly, to inclusion of irrelevant covariates in the analysis. We used data from four supermarket trials on the effects of pricing strategies on fruit and vegetables purchases, to show that results from fully adjusted analyses sometimes do appreciably differ from results from analyses adjusted for significant baseline differences only. We propose to adjust for known or anticipated important prognostic variables. These could or should be pre-specified in trial protocols. Subsequently, authors should report results from the fully adjusted as well as crude analyses, especially for dichotomous and time to event data. Summary: Based on our arguments, which were illustrated by our findings, we propose that journals in and outside the field of nutrition behavior actively adopt the CONSORT 2010 statement on this topic by not publishing significance tests for baseline differences anymore.},

Given that reliabilities vary as a function of the design of these tasks and the characteristics of the individuals taking them, making inferences about the reliability of scores in an ongoing study based on reliability estimates from prior studies is precarious. Thus, it would be advantageous to estimate reliability based on data from the ongoing study. We argue that internal consistency estimates of reliability are underutilized for experimental task data and in many applications could provide this information using a single administration of a task. We discuss different methods for computing internal consistency estimates with a generalized coefficient alpha and the conditions under which these estimates are accurate. We illustrate use of these coefficients using data for three different tasks.},

	abstract = {The present study examined EEG gamma (35-70 Hz) spectral power distributions during worry inductions in participants suffering from generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and in control participants without a history of psychiatric illness. As hypothesized, the EEG gamma band was useful for differentiating worry from baseline and relaxation. During worry induction, GAD patients showed higher levels of gamma activity than control participants in posterior electrode sites that have been previously associated with negative emotion. Gamma fluctuations in these electrode sites were correlated with subjective emotional experience ratings lending additional support to interpretations of negative affect. Following 14 weeks of psychotherapy, the GAD group reported less negative affect with worry inductions and the corresponding gamma sites that previously differentiated the clinical from control groups changed for the GAD patients in the direction of control participants. These findings suggest converging evidence that patients suffering from GAD experience more negative emotion during worry and that the EEG gamma band is useful for monitoring fluctuations in pathological worry expected to follow successful treatment.},

	abstract = {The role of worry in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) has been posited to serve as an avoidance of emotional experience, and emotion regulation deÔ¨Åcits in GAD have been found in several previous studies. It remains unclear whether those with GAD experience more dysregulated emotions during periods of euthymia and positive affect or whether these deÔ¨Åcits occur only during periods of worry. Individuals with GAD (with and without co-occurring dysphoria) and non-anxious controls were randomly assigned to receive a worry, neutral, or relaxation induction. Following the induction, all participants viewed a Ô¨Ålm clip documented to elicit sadness. Intensity of emotions and emotion regulation were examined following the induction period and Ô¨Ålm clip. The results revealed that, regardless of co-occurring dysphoria, individuals with GAD in the worry condition experienced more intense depressed affect than GAD participants in the other conditions and controls participants. In contrast, presence of worry appeared to have less impact on indices of emotion dysregulation, which were greater in participants with GAD compared to controls, but largely insensitive to contextual effects of worry or of relaxation. Following Ô¨Ålm viewing, both GAD participants with and without dysphoria displayed poorer understanding, acceptance, and management of emotions than did controls. However, acceptance and management deÔ¨Åcits were most pronounced in individuals with both GAD and co-occurring dysphoria. Implications for the role of emotions in conceptualization and treatment of GAD are discussed.},

	abstract = {Background: When switching from one task to a new one, reaction times are prolonged. This phenomenon is called switch cost (SC). Researchers have recently used several kinds of task-switching paradigms to uncover neural mechanisms underlying the SC. Task-set reconfiguration and passive dissipation of a previously relevant task-set have been reported to contribute to the cost of task switching.
Methodology/Principal Findings: An unpredictable cued task-switching paradigm was used, during which subjects were instructed to switch between a color and an orientation discrimination task. Electroencephalography (EEG) and behavioral measures were recorded in 14 subjects. Response-stimulus interval (RSI) and cue-stimulus interval (CSI) were manipulated with short and long intervals, respectively. Switch trials delayed reaction times (RTs) and increased error rates compared with repeat trials. The SC of RTs was smaller in the long CSI condition. For cue-locked waveforms, switch trials generated a larger parietal positive event-related potential (ERP), and a larger slow parietal positivity compared with repeat trials in the short and long CSI condition. Neural SC of cue-related ERP positivity was smaller in the long RSI condition. For stimuluslocked waveforms, a larger switch-related central negative ERP component was observed, and the neural SC of the ERP negativity was smaller in the long CSI. Results of standardized low resolution electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) for both ERP positivity and negativity showed that switch trials evoked larger activation than repeat trials in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC).
Conclusions/Significance: The results provide evidence that both RSI and CSI modulate the neural activities in the process of task-switching, but that these have a differential role during task-set reconfiguration and passive dissipation of a previously relevant task-set.},

	abstract = {Objective: The Attention Network Test (ANT) is a tool used to assess the efÔ¨Åciency of the 3 attention networks‚Äîalerting, orienting, and executive control. The ANT has become popular in the neuropsychological literature since its Ô¨Årst description in 2002, with some form of the task currently appearing in no less than 65 original research papers. Although several general reviews of the ANT exist, none provide an analysis of its psychometric properties. Method: Data from 15 unique studies were collected, resulting in a large sample (N œ≠ 1,129) of healthy individuals. Split-half reliability, variance structure, distribution shape, and independence of measurement of the 3 attention network scores were analyzed, considering both reaction time and accuracy as dependent variables. Results: Split-half reliabilities of reaction time based attention network scores were low for alerting (rweighted œ≠ .20, CI 95\%weighted [.14, .27], Spearman‚ÄìBrown r œ≠ .38) and orienting (rweighted œ≠ .32, CI 95\%weighted [.26, .38], Spearman‚ÄìBrown r œ≠ .55), and moderate high for executive control (rweighted œ≠ .65, CI 95\%weighted [.61, .71], Spearman‚ÄìBrown r œ≠ .81). Analysis of the variance structure of the ANT indicated that power to Ô¨Ånd signiÔ¨Åcant effects was variable across networks and dependent on the statistical analysis being used. Both analysis of variance (signiÔ¨Åcant interaction observed in 100\% of 15 studies) and correlational analyses (multiplesigniÔ¨Åcant inter-network correlations observed) suggest that the networks measured by the ANT are not independent. Conclusions: In the collection, analysis and interpretation of any test data, psychometric properties, such as those reported here for the ANT, must be carefully considered.},

Using the AX-CPT cognitive control task as a case study example, we address four concerns that one may encounter when researching the topic of individual differences in cognition. First, we demonstrate the importance of variability in task scores, which in turn directly impacts reliability, particularly when comparing correlations in different populations. Second, we demonstrate the importance of variability and reliability for evaluating potential failures to replicate predicted correlations, even within the same population. Third, we demonstrate how researchers can turn to evaluating psychometric properties as a way of evaluating the feasibility of utilizing the task in new settings (e.g., online administration). Lastly, we show how the examination of psychometric properties can help researchers make informed decisions when designing a study, such as determining the appropriate number of trials for a task.},

Here, we assessed training efÔ¨Åcacy in ameliorating interpretation biases and anxious mood in adolescents with anxiety disorders. Twenty-eight Chinese adolescents meeting criteria for a current anxiety disorder were randomly assigned to receive positive or neutral CBM-I training. Training involved completing a word-fragment to resolve the outcomes of sixty ambiguous scenarios. During positive training, scenarios ended with benign/positive resolutions, but during neutral training, half of the scenarios were resolved positively and half negatively. Positively trained patients interpreted new ambiguous scenarios less negatively than the neutral training group although training effects were not observed on a questionnaire measure of interpretation bias. Training effects on mood were also absent. Before the clinical implications of CBM-I can be considered in adolescents, research needs to establish optimal training parameters for symptom-changes to occur.},

The present study was designed to modify a negative interpretive bias in highly anxious individuals, and subsequently assess the hypothesized beneÔ¨Åcial effects on clinical measures. High trait-anxious participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: a positive interpretational Cognitive Bias ModiÔ¨Åcation (CBM-I) or a control condition (n = 2 √Ç 17). The program was offered online for eight consecutive days. Upon completing the program, participants who had followed positive CBM-I were less state and trait-anxious compared to the control group. Additionally, positively trained participants scored lower on a measure of general psychopathology (SCL-90). No effects were observed on social anxiety and stress vulnerability. The mixed pattern of Ô¨Åndings renders them rather inconclusive, leaving interpretations of the potential therapeutic merits of CBM-I open for future research.},

	abstract = {Bayesian parameter estimation and Bayesian hypothesis testing present attractive alternatives to classical inference using confidence intervals and p values. In part I of this series we outline ten prominent advantages of the Bayesian approach. Many of these advantages translate to concrete opportunities for pragmatic researchers. For instance, Bayesian hypothesis testing allows researchers to quantify evidence and monitor its progression as data come in, without needing to know the intention with which the data were collected. We end by countering several objections to Bayesian hypothesis testing. Part II of this series discusses JASP, a free and open source software program that makes it easy to conduct Bayesian estimation and testing for a range of popular statistical scenarios (Wagenmakers et al., this issue).},

	abstract = {Reliability in classical test theory is a population-dependent concept, defined as a ratio of true-score variance and observed-score variance, where observed-score variance is a sum of true and error components. On the other hand, the power of a statistical significance test is a function of the total variance, irrespective of its decomposition into true and error components. For that reason, the reliability of a dependent variable is a function of the ratio of true-score variance and observed-score variance, whereas statistical power is a function of the sum of the same two variances. Controversies about how reliability is related to statistical power often can be explained by authors‚Äô use of the term ‚Äúreliability‚Äù in a general way to mean ‚Äúconsistency,‚Äù ‚Äúprecision,‚Äù or ‚Äúdependability,‚Äù which does not always correspond to its mathematical definition as a variance ratio.

	abstract = {Background and Objectives: Abnormal threat-related attention in anxiety disorders is most commonly assessed and modified using the dot-probe paradigm; however, poor psychometric properties of reaction-time measures may contribute to inconsistencies across studies. Typically, standard attention measures are derived using average reaction-times obtained in experimentallydefined conditions. However, current approaches based on experimentally-defined conditions are limited. In this study, the psychometric properties of a novel response-based computation approach to analyze dot-probe data are compared to standard measures of attention.
Methods: 148 adults (19.19 ¬± 1.42, 84 women) completed a standardized dot-probe task including threatening and neutral faces. We generated both standard and response-based measures of attention bias, attentional orientation, and attentional disengagement. We compared overall internal consistency, number of trials necessary to reach internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and criterion validity obtained using each approach.
Results: Compared to standard attention measures, response-based measures demonstrated uniformly high levels of internal consistency with relatively few trials and varying improvements in test-retest reliability. Additionally, response-based measures demonstrated specific evidence of anxiety-related associations above and beyond both standard attention measures and other confounds. Limitations: Future studies are necessary to validate this approach in clinical samples.
Conclusions: Response-based attention measures demonstrate superior psychometric properties compared to standard attention measures, which may improve the detection of anxiety-related associations and treatment-related changes in clinical samples.},

	abstract = {Background and objectives: For decades, the dominant paradigm in trait anxiety research has regarded the construct as signifying the underlying cause of the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that supposedly reflect its presence. Recently, a network theory of personality has appeared. According to this perspective, trait anxiety is a formative construct emerging from interactions among its constitutive features (e.g., thought, feelings, behaviors); it is not a latent cause of these features. Design: In this study, we characterized trait anxiety as a network system of interacting elements.
Methods: To do so, we estimated a graphical gaussian model via the computation of a regularized partial correlation network in an unselected sample (N = 611). We also implemented modularity-based community detection analysis to test whether the features of trait anxiety cohere as a single network system.
Results: We find that trait anxiety can indeed be conceptualized as a single, coherent network system of interacting elements.
Conclusions: This radically new approach to visualizing trait anxiety may offer an especially informative view of the interplay between its constitutive features. As prior research has implicated trait anxiety as a risk factor for the development of anxiety-related psychopathology, our findings also set the scene for novel research directions.},

	abstract = {The recent field-wide emphasis on power has brought the number of participants used in psychological experiments into focus. Social psychology typically follows a tradition in which many participants perform a small number of trials each; in psychophysics, the tradition is to include only a few participants, who perform many trials each; and the tradition in cognitive psychology falls in between, balancing the number of participants and trials. We ask whether it is better to add trials or to add participants if one wishes to increase power. The answer is straightforward‚Äîgreatest power is achieved by using more people, and the gain from adding people is greater than the gain from adding trials. In light of these results, the design parameters in the social psychology tradition seem ideal. Yet there are conditions in which one may trade people for trials with only a minor decrement in power. Under these conditions, the limiting factor is the trial-to-trial variability rather than the variability across people in the population. These conditions are highly plausible, and we present a theoretical argument as to why. We think that most cognitive effects are characterized by stochastic dominance; that is, everyone‚Äôs true effect is in the same direction. For example, it is plausible that when performing the Stroop task, all people truly identify congruent colors faster than incongruent ones. When dominance holds, small mean effects imply a small degree of variability across the population. It is this degree of homogeneity, the consequence of dominance, that licenses the design parameters of the cognitive psychology and psychophysics traditions.},

These analyses are surprisingly complex, particularly if only two waves of data are available.

With the help of simulated longitudinal data of body mass index in children, we review statistical methods for the analysis of the association between the baseline value and subsequent change, assuming linear growth with time. Key issues in such analyses are mathematical coupling, measurement error, variability of change between individuals, and regression to the mean. Ideally, it is better to rely on multiple repeated measurements at different times and a linear random effects model is a standard approach if more than two waves of data are available. If only two waves of data are available, our simulations show that Blomqvist‚Äôs method ‚Äì which consists in adjusting for measurement error variance the estimated regression coefÔ¨Åcient of observed change on baseline value ‚Äì provides accurate estimates.

The purpose of this investigation was to (a) determine the frequency with which published articles appearing in health education and behavior journals report the psychometric properties of the scales/subscales employed and (b) outline the methods used to determine the reliability and validity of the scores produced. The results reported herein are based on a final sample of 967 published articles, spanning seven prominent health education and behavior journals between 2007 and 2010. Of the 967 articles examined, an exceedingly high percentage failed to report any validity (ranging from 40\% to 93\%) or reliability (ranging from 35\% to 80\%) statistics in their articles. For health education/behavior practitioners and researchers to maximize the utility and applicability of their findings, they must evaluate the psychometric properties of the instrument employed, a practice that is currently underrepresented in the literature. By not ensuring the instruments employed in a given study were able to produce accurate and consistent scores, researchers cannot be certain they actually measured the behaviors and/or constructs reported.},

Prior studies predominantly used (a) small samples with low power for precise estimation, (b) nonclinical samples, and (c) single samples. This renders network structures in clinical data, and the extent to which networks replicate across data sets, unknown. To overcome these limitations, the present cross-cultural multisite study estimated regularized partial correlation networks of 16 PTSD symptoms across four data sets of traumatized patients receiving treatment for PTSD (total N = 2,782). Despite differences in culture, trauma type, and severity of the samples, considerable similarities emerged, with moderate to high correlations between symptom profiles (0.43‚Äì0.82), network structures (0.62‚Äì0.74), and centrality estimates (0.63‚Äì0.75). We discuss the importance of future replicability efforts to improve clinical psychological science and provide code, model output, and correlation matrices to make the results of this article fully reproducible.},

The conventional procedures of statistical power analysis fail to provide appropriate answers to these questions because they are based on statistical models in which stimuli are not assumed to be a source of random variation in the data, models that are inappropriate for experiments involving crossed random factors of participants and stimuli. In this article, we present new methods of power analysis for designs with crossed random factors, and we give detailed, practical guidance to psychology researchers planning experiments in which a sample of participants responds to a sample of stimuli. We extensively examine 5 commonly used experimental designs, describe how to estimate statistical power in each, and provide power analysis results based on a reasonable set of default parameter values. We then develop general conclusions and formulate rules of thumb concerning the optimal design of experiments in which a sample of participants responds to a sample of stimuli. We show that in crossed designs, statistical power typically does not approach unity as the number of participants goes to infinity but instead approaches a maximum attainable power value that is possibly small, depending on the stimulus sample. We also consider the statistical merits of designs involving multiple stimulus blocks. Finally, we provide a simple and flexible Web-based power application to aid researchers in planning studies with samples of stimuli.},

The application of traditional analytic methods to the data from such studies can result in serious bias in testing experimental effects. In this review, we develop a comprehensive typology of designs involving two random factors, which may be either crossed or nested, and one Ô¨Åxed factor, condition. We present appropriate linear mixed models for all designs and develop effect size measures. We provide the tools for power estimation for all designs.

For example, if test administration costs are 7 \% of the total experimental costs, the efficient value of the reliability is .93. If the actual reliability of a test is equal to this efficient reliability, the test size maximizes the statistical power of the experiment, given the costs. As a standard in experimental research, it is proposed that the reliability of the dependent variable be close to the efficient reliability. Adhering to this standard will enhance the statistical power and reduce the costs of experiments.},

Surprisingly, only a small fraction of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies report or cite the reliability of brain activation maps involved in group analyses. Here, using simulations and exemplary longitudinal data of 126 healthy adolescents performing an intertemporal choice task, we demonstrate that reproducing a group activation map over time is not a sufficient indication of reliable measurements at the individual level. Instead, selecting regions based on significant main effects at the group level may yield estimates that fail to reliably capture individual variance in the subjective evaluation of an offer. Collectively, our results call for more attention on the reliability of supposed biomarkers at the level of the individual. Thus, caution is warranted in employing brain activation patterns prematurely for clinical applications such as diagnosis or tailored interventions before their reliability has been conclusively established by large-scale studies. To facilitate assessing and reporting of the reliability of fMRI contrasts in future studies, we provide a toolbox that incorporates common measures of global and local reliability.},

Recently, the foundations of this paradigm have been shaken by several notable replication failures. One recommendation to remedy the replication crisis is to collect larger samples of participants. We argue that this recommendation misses a critical point, which is that increasing sample size will not remedy psychology‚Äôs lack of strong measurement, lack of strong theories and models, and lack of effective experimental control over error variance. In contrast, there is a long history of research in psychology employing small-N designs that treats the individual participant as the replication unit, which addresses each of these failings, and which produces results that are robust and readily replicated. We illustrate the properties of small-N and largeN designs using a simulated paradigm investigating the stage structure of response times. Our simulations highlight the high power and inferential validity of the small-N design, in contrast to the lower power and inferential indeterminacy of the large-N design. We argue that, if psychology is to be a mature quantitative science, then its primary theoretical aim should be to investigate systematic, functional relationships as they are manifested at the individual participant level and that, wherever possible, it should use methods that are optimized to identify relationships of this kind.},

Yet there has been little investigation of task manipulations that can experimentally modulate the use of proactive control in healthy young adults; such manipulations could be useful to better understand the workings of cognitive control mechanisms. In the current study, a series of three experiments demonstrate how individuals can be systematically biased toward and away from the utilization of proactive control, via strategy training and no-go manipulations, respectively. These results provide increased support for the DMC framework, and provide a new basis from which to examine group-based differences and neural mechanisms underlying the two control modes.},

We hypothesize that high WMC individuals are more likely to utilize proactive control yielding not only benefits, but also specific costs to performance. Across two separate, large-sample experiments, healthy young adults performed different variants of the AX-CPT context processing task, a well-established probe of proactive and reactive cognitive control. In two experiments, WMC predicted both improvements and relative impairments in task performance in a manner that was consistent with usage of proactive control.

	abstract = {Background: In the current study, we investigated whether the internal reliability of the visual probe task measure of attentional bias for substance-related cues could be improved by incorporating eye-tracking methods and personalised stimuli.
Method: Sixty social drinkers completed two visual probe tasks: one with a broad range of different alcohol pictures, the other containing only images of the participants‚Äô preferred drink. Attentional bias was inferred from manual reaction times to probes replacing the pictures, and from the duration of eye movement Ô¨Åxations towards the pictures (gaze dwell time).
Results: Internal reliability was highest for personalised (versus general) alcohol stimuli, and for eyetracking (versus manual reaction time) measures of attentional bias. The internal reliability of both reaction time (Àõ = .73) and gaze dwell time measures (Àõ = .76) of attentional bias for personalised alcohol stimuli was acceptable. Internal reliability of indices of attentional bias for general alcohol stimuli was inferior, although better for the gaze dwell time (Àõ = .51) compared to the reaction time measure (Àõ = .19). Attentional bias towards personalised stimuli was larger than bias to general stimuli, but only for the reaction time measure. There were no statistically signiÔ¨Åcant associations between measures of attentional bias and alcohol consumption or craving.
Conclusions: Adopting personalised stimuli and eye movement monitoring signiÔ¨Åcantly improves the internal reliability of the alcohol-related visual probe task. ¬© 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The methods and the results of these ERP studies must be published in a way that allows other scientists to understand exactly what was done so that they can, if necessary, replicate the experiments.

Methods are taught under the assumption that a researcher already knows the research question and knows which methods will fit that question. Similarly, the real complexity of the thought processes that lead to a scientific undertaking is almost never described in published papers. In this paper, we first discuss how to get an idea that is worth researching. We describe sources of new ideas and how to foster a creative attitude by ‚Äúcultivating your thoughts‚Äù. Only a few of these ideas will make it into a study. Next, we describe how to sharpen and focus a research question so that a study becomes feasible and a valid test of the underlying idea. To do this, the idea needs to be ‚Äúpruned‚Äù. Pruning a research question means cutting away anything that is unnecessary, so that only the essence remains. This includes determining both the latent and the stated objectives, specific pruning questions, and the use of specific schemes to structure reasoning. After this, the following steps include preparation of a brief protocol, conduct of a pilot study, and writing a draft of the paper including draft tables. Then you are ready to carry out your research.},

This lateralized readiness potential (LRP) starts even before the response is emitted, and its onset has been taken as a measure of the time at which the brain began preparing to make the response. The LRP has also been used to measure the preliminary activation of a response that is never actually produced. The LRP is a valuable measure of relatively central response activation that is now widely used in many areas of psychology involving reaction time tasks. This chapter discusses the definition of LRP, methods of isolating LRP from other components, brain systems generating the LRP, uses of LRP, and analyses of LRP.},

Moreover, recent research points to theoretical revisions deemphasizing ABT as a stable, near-universal feature of anxiety disorders, and stressing deficits in executive control as the primary attentional problem linked to anxiety.},

	abstract = {This electroencephalographic (EEG) study investigated the impact of between-task competition on intentional control in voluntary task switching. Anticipatory preparation for an upcoming task switch is a hallmark of top-down intentional control. Meanwhile, asymmetries in performance and voluntary choice when switching between tasks differing in relative strength reveal the effects of between-task competition, reÔ¨Çected in a surprising bias against switching to an easier task. Here, we assessed the impact of this bias on EEG markers of intentional control during preparation for an upcoming task switch. The results revealed strong and varied effects of between-task competition on EEG markers of global task preparation‚Äîa frontal contingent negative variation (CNV), a posterior slow positive wave, and oscillatory activity in the alpha band (8‚Äì12 Hz) over posterior scalp sites. In contrast, we observed no between-task differences in motor-speciÔ¨Åc task preparation, as indexed by the lateralized readiness potential and by motor-related amplitude asymmetries in the mu (9‚Äì13 Hz) and beta (18‚Äì26 Hz) frequency bands. Collectively, these Ô¨Åndings demonstrate that between-task competition directly inÔ¨Çuences the formation of top-down intentions, not only their expression in overt behavior. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, this inÔ¨Çuence occurs at the level of global task intention rather than the preparation of speciÔ¨Åc actions.},

Several dissociations between LRP and mu-MRAA and beta-MRAA were found. Mu-MRAA and beta-MRAA, but not LRP, exhibited an early and strong reversal in cortical lateralization when advance preparation for a switch of response hand was required. LRP, but not mu-MRAA or beta-MRAA, was sensitive to manipulation of the probability that advance preparation of response hand would be useful in a response precuing task. These dissociations replicate earlier findings and suggest that movement-related cortical rhythms and cortical potentials are associated with distinct preparatory component processes that differ in terms of level of abstraction and effort, in line with similar functional distinctions between component processes underlying executive control in task switching. This suggests that a fine-grained analysis of subprocesses involved in motor control may provide important guiding principles for the study and understanding of levels and mechanisms of cognitive control.},

However, there may be conditions (e.g., prior presentation of threat-related stimuli) in which that assumption is not applicable. The extensive recent research (including several cognitive neuroscience studies) of direct relevance to the theory is discussed, and suggestions are made for maximizing the value of future cognitive neuroscience research. Finally, attentional control theory is developed to explicate the relationship between anxiety and motivation. Implications for theoretical predictions and alternative theoretical accounts are discussed.},

Using an anonymous elicitation format supplemented by incentives for honest reporting, we surveyed over 2,000 psychologists about their involvement in questionable research practices. The impact of truth-telling incentives on self-admissions of questionable research practices was positive, and this impact was greater for practices that respondents judged to be less defensible. Combining three different estimation methods, we found that the percentage of respondents who have engaged in questionable practices was surprisingly high. This finding suggests that some questionable practices may constitute the prevailing research norm.},

In Experiment 2 (N œ≠ 42), participants were given a stressful anagram task, and those who switched more efficiently from a neutral set to an emotional set were more frustrated by the stressful task. In addition, those who switched more efficiently from an emotional set to a neutral set persisted longer on the stressful task.

We also include scales developed or adapted for children and adolescents. In the extant literature, measures of repetitive thinking generally show small-to-moderate correlations with measures of psychopathology. This review highlights problems with the content validity of existing instruments; for example, confounds between repetitive thought and symptomatology, metacognitive beliefs, and affect. This review also builds on previous reviews by including newer transdiagnostic measures of repetitive thinking. We hope that this review will help to expand our understanding of repetitive thinking beyond the mood and anxiety disorders, and suggest ways forward in the measurement of repetitive thinking in individuals with comorbid conditions.},

The measure is based on a control theory perspective of worry and separates the tendency to worry in a way that facilitates goal-pursuit and threat reduction (constructive worry) from the tendency to worry in a way that hinders goal-pursuit while sustaining threat awareness (unconstructive worry). CUWQ scores were validated in 2 independent nonclinical samples, including North American (Sample 1, N œ≠ 295) and Australian (Sample 2, N œ≠ 998) residents. Final factor items were selected based on Sample 1, and the measure showed good model fit through a confirmatory factor analysis in Sample 2. In addition, scores on the 2 worry factors showed criterion-related validity by statistically predicting a variety of outcomes in both samples: Constructive worry was positively associated with punctuality and wildfire preparedness and negatively associated with trait-anxiety and amount of worry. Unconstructive worry, on the other hand, was positively associated with trait-anxiety and amount of worry, and negatively associated with punctuality and wildfire preparedness. The 2 factor scores were uncorrelated in Sample 1 and positively correlated in Sample 2, thereby showing that having a tendency to worry in an unconstructive manner does not prohibit 1 from worrying in a constructive manner as well. Understanding how the 2 tendencies to worry differ from each other and separating their measurement enables a better understanding of the role of worry in both normal behavior and psychopathology.},

	abstract = {Background: Repetitive negative thinking (RNT) increases vulnerability to multiple anxiety and depressive disorders and, as a common risk factor, elevated RNT may account for the high levels of comorbidity observed between emotional disorders. The aims of this study were to (a) compare two common forms of RNT (worry and rumination) across individuals with non-comorbid anxiety or depressive disorders, and (b) to examine the relationship between RNT and comorbidity.
Methods: A structured diagnostic interview and measures of rumination, worry, anxiety, and depression were completed by a large clinical sample with an anxiety disorder or depression (N¬º 513) presenting at a community mental health clinic.
Results: Patients without (n ¬º 212) and with (n ¬º 301) comorbid diagnoses did not generally differ across the principal diagnosis groups (depression, generalised anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder) on worry or rumination. As predicted, comorbidity was associated with a higher level of RNT. Limitations: Cross-sectional design precluded causal conclusions and Ô¨Åndings may not generalize to excluded anxiety disorders.
Conclusions: Consistent with the transdiagnostic hypothesis, RNT was associated with a range of anxiety disorders and depression and with comorbidity for those with a principal depressive disorder, supporting recent evidence that RNT is a transdiagnostic process. The presence of RNT, speciÔ¨Åcally worry and rumination, should be assessed and treated regardless of diagnostic proÔ¨Åle. Future research may show that both pure and comorbid depressed or anxious patients receive incremental beneÔ¨Åt from transdiagnostic protocols developed to treat core pathological processes of RNT traditionally associated with separate disorders.},

	abstract = {Background and objectives: Repetitive negative thinking (RNT) is common to multiple emotional disorders and occurs before, during, and following a stressor. One replicated difference between common forms of RNT such as worry and rumination is temporal orientation towards a stressor, with worry being more future-oriented and rumination more past-oriented. Different mechanisms may drive RNT at these different time points. The aim of Study 1 was to examine whether previously demonstrated relationships between post-stressor RNT and mechanisms theorized to drive engagement in RNT, including metacognitive beliefs, cognitive avoidance strategies, and thought control strategies, would be replicated with anticipatory (pre-stressor) RNT. The aim of Study 2 was to replicate these associations in a new sample that completed measures of both pre- and post-stressor RNT.
Method: Participants in Study 1 (N ¬º 175) completed the RNT-L in anticipation of a stressor, along with measures of metacognitive beliefs, cognitive avoidance strategies, and thought control strategies. Participants in Study 2 (N ¬º 91) completed the measures both before and after a stressor. Results: Preand post-stressor RNT were signiÔ¨Åcantly correlated with all three mechanism measures. Metacognitive beliefs that RNT is uncontrollable and dangerous, and the thought control strategy of punishment, were most consistently and uniquely associated with RNT at both time-points. Limitations: Replication with clinical samples and with reference to a broader array of stressors is required. The correlational design precluded causal conclusions.
Conclusions: Common and possibly some distinct mechanisms drive RNT before and after a stressor. √ì 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Although several measures of RNT are available, the items of most of these instruments index RNT that is speciÔ¨Åc to particular diagnostic groups (e.g., RNT about depression symptoms). This has limited our ability to examine the relevance of RNT across diagnostic groups and advance our understanding of RNT as a transdiagnostic process. This study evaluated the psychometric properties of the Repetitive Thinking Questionnaire (RTQ), a transdiagnostic measure of RNT. In a clinical sample of individuals with anxiety and depressive disorders (N = 186), the RTQ demonstrated good internal consistency, convergent, and divergent validity. Supporting the transdiagnostic nature of the measure, the Repetitive Negative Thinking subscale of the RTQ was associated with a variety of negative emotions and metacognitive beliefs, and signiÔ¨Åcantly predicted symptoms of multiple disorders when controlling for neuroticism. Our Ô¨Åndings support the use of the RTQ as a transdiagnostic, trans-emotional measure of maladaptive repetitive thought following distressing events, with scope to increase efÔ¨Åciency and reduce burden on patients by assessing RNT in clinical settings with one short measure. Experimental and longitudinal research identifying mechanisms driving RNT using the RTQ would be informative for theory and treatment developments.},

	title = {Implications of the {Credibility} {Revolution} for {Productivity}, {Creativity}, and {Progress}},
	abstract = {The credibility revolution (sometimes referred to as the ‚Äúreplicability crisis‚Äù) in psychology has brought about many changes in the standards by which psychological science is evaluated. These changes include (a) greater emphasis on transparency and openness, (b) a move toward preregistration of research, (c) more direct-replication studies, and (d) higher standards for the quality and quantity of evidence needed to make strong scientific claims. What are the implications of these changes for productivity, creativity, and progress in psychological science? These questions can and should be studied empirically, and I present my predictions here. The productivity of individual researchers is likely to decline, although some changes (e.g., greater collaboration, data sharing) may mitigate this effect. The effects of these changes on creativity are likely to be mixed: Researchers will be less likely to pursue risky questions; more likely to use a broad range of methods, designs, and populations; and less free to define their own best practices and standards of evidence. Finally, the rate of scientific progress‚Äîthe most important shared goal of scientists‚Äîis likely to increase as a result of these changes, although one‚Äôs subjective experience of making progress will likely become rarer.},

Researchers themselves may not be immune to these fallacies and may unwittingly adjust their statistical analysis to produce an outcome that is more pleasant or better in line with prior expectations. To shield researchers from the impact of cognitive fallacies, several methodologists are now advocating preregistration‚Äîthat is, the creation of a detailed analysis plan before data collection or data analysis. One may argue, however, that preregistration is out of touch with academic reality, hampering creativity and impeding scientific progress. We provide a historical overview to show that the interplay between creativity and verification has shaped theories of scientific inquiry throughout the centuries; in the currently dominant theory, creativity and verification operate in succession and enhance one another‚Äôs effectiveness. From this perspective, the use of preregistration to safeguard the verification stage will help rather than hinder the generation of fruitful new ideas.},

Three components of emotions are traditionally distinguished: valence (the pleasantness of the stimulus), arousal (the intensity of emotion provoked by the stimulus), and dominance (the degree of control exerted by the stimulus). Thus far, nearly all research has been based on the ANEW norms collected by Bradley and Lang (1999) for 1,034 words. We extend the database to nearly 14 thousand English lemmas, providing researchers with a much richer source of information, including information on gender, age and educational differences in emotion norms. As an example of the new possibilities, we included the stimuli from nearly all category norms (types of diseases, occupations, and taboo words) collected by Van Overschelde, Rawson,and Dunlosky (2004), making it possible to include affect in studies on semantic memory.},

	abstract = {Recent efforts have been made to understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying psychological resilience. Cognitive flexibility in the context of affective information has been related to individual differences in resilience. However, it is unclear whether flexible affective processing is sensitive to mood fluctuations. Furthermore, it remains to be investigated how effects on flexible affective processing interact with the affective valence of information that is presented. To fill this gap, we tested the effects of positive mood and individual differences in self-reported resilience on affective flexibility, using a task switching paradigm (N œ≠ 80). The main findings showed that positive mood was related to lower task switching costs, reflecting increased flexibility, in line with previous findings. In line with this effect of positive mood, we showed that greater resilience levels, specifically levels of acceptance of self and life, also facilitated task set switching in the context of affective information. However, the effects of resilience on affective flexibility seem more complex. Resilience tended to relate to more efficient task switching when negative information was preceded by positive information, possibly because the presentation of positive information, as well as positive mood, can facilitate task set switching. Positive mood also influenced costs associated with switching affective valence of the presented information. This latter effect was indicative of a reduced impact of no longer relevant negative information and more impact of no longer relevant positive information. Future research should confirm these effects of individual differences in resilience on affective flexibility, considering the affective valence of the presented information.},

In addition, HTA individuals showed a stronger tendency to attentional avoidance of threat at the 200 and 500 ms picture presentation.

Asymmetric recall favoring positive stimuli appears to be part of the normative pattern of memory performance among individuals that have been labeled normal nondepressed (ah = .15; p {\textless} ,001); subclinically depressed individuals show symmetric recall of positively and negatively valenced material (Jh = - .02; p {\textgreater} .20).

With the exception of induced elated mood, effect estimates derived from different studies are robust in that sampling error accounts for the entire variability among effect estimates obtainedfrom different studies. In studies on induced-elated mood, self-referent processing was associated with stronger mood-congruent recall as compared to other studies.

Specifically, there is support for explicit memory biases for threat-relevant information in panic disorder (PD), particularly when information has been deeply encoded, but not in social phobia (SP) or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The few available studies suggest the presence of explicit memory biases in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and obsessive ‚Äì compulsive disorder (OCD), but further research is needed. In contrast, some degree of support for implicit memory biases has been demonstrated for each of the anxiety disorders. Inconsistencies in the existing literature, topics worthy of future research attention, and directions for revising existing information-processing models of anxiety are discussed.

This evidence points to an important distinction between hippocampally-dependent and non-hippocampally-dependent forms of memory that are differentially affected by extreme stress. The cognitive science perspective is related to a recent model of posttraumatic stress disorder, dual representation theory, that also posits separate memory systems underlying vivid reexperiencing versus ordinary autobiographical memories of trauma. This view is compared with other accounts in the literature of traumatic memory processes in PTSD, and the contrasting implications for therapy are discussed. ¬© 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The implicit memory test was a primed lexica1 decision task, which included anxiety- and depression-relevant words, and supraliminal and subliminal priming conditions. The explicit memory test was incidental free recall following a self-referent encoding task. Subjects were divided into high and low negative affect groups, differing in trait and state anxiety, and depression scores. The high negative affect group showed greater subliminal priming of depression-relevant than neutral control words compared with the low negative affect group. This selective priming effect was more closely associated with depression than anxiety measures. There was little direct evidence of emotion-congruent biases on the supraliminally primed lexical decision and free recall tasks, although when the effects of anxiety were partialled out depression scores predicted relatively better recall of depression-relevant words. In conclusion, the main results suggest that non-clinical depression is associated with a mood-con{\textasciitilde}uent bias in automatic aspects of implicit memory.},

Here, we used this approach to explore the visual representation of facial expressions of emotion. Participants were adapted to anti-expressions of six facial expressions. The participants were then shown an average face and asked to classify the face‚Äôs expression using one of six basic emotion descriptors. Participants chose the emotion matching the antiexpression they were adapted to significantly more often than they chose any other emotion (e.g., if they were adapted to antifear, they classified the emotion on the average face as fear). The strength of this aftereffect of adaptation decreased as the strength of the anti-expression adapter decreased. These findings provide evidence that visual representations of facial expressions of emotion are coded with reference to a prototype within a multidimensional framework.},

Methods. In 2009, we analyzed data from the 1995 and 2005 Midlife in the United States cross-sectional surveys (n = 1723), which measured positive mental health and 12-month mental disorders of major depressive episode, panic, and generalized anxiety disorders.
Results. Population prevalence of any of 3 mental disorders and levels of mental health appeared stable but were dynamic at the individual level. Fifty-two percent of the 17.5\% of respondents with any mental illness in 2005 were new cases; one half of those languishing in 1995 improved in 2005, and one half of those Ô¨Çourishing in 1995 declined in 2005. Change in mental health was strongly predictive of prevalence and incidence (operationalized as a new, not necessarily a Ô¨Årst, episode) of mental illness in 2005.
Conclusions. Gains in mental health predicted declines in mental illness, supporting the call for public mental health promotion; losses of mental health predicted increases in mental illness, supporting the call for public mental health protection.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: While considerable attention has focused on improving the detection of depression, assessment of severity is also important in guiding treatment decisions. Therefore, we examined the validity of a brief, new measure of depression severity.
MEASUREMENTS: The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as ``0'' (not at all) to ``3'' (nearly every day). The PHQ-9 was completed by 6,000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Construct validity was assessed using the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey, selfreported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (MHP) interview in a sample of 580 patients.
RESULTS: As PHQ-9 depression severity increased, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and health care utilization increased. Using the MHP reinterview as the criterion standard, a PHQ-9 score !10 had a sensitivity of 88\% and a specificity of 88\% for major depression. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. Results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples.
CONCLUSION: In addition to making criteria-based diagnoses of depressive disorders, the PHQ-9 is also a reliable and valid measure of depression severity. These characteristics plus its brevity make the PHQ-9 a useful clinical and research tool.},

Without disputing their importance, these foci fail to capture many of the Ô¨Çuctuating, conÔ¨Çicting forces that are readily apparent when people navigate the environment and social world. In this paper, we review literature to offer evidence for the prominence of psychological Ô¨Çexibility in understanding psychological health. Thus far, the importance of psychological Ô¨Çexibility has been obscured by the isolation and disconnection of research conducted on this topic. Psychological Ô¨Çexibility spans a wide range of human abilities to: recognize and adapt to various situational demands; shift mindsets or behavioral repertoires when these strategies compromise personal or social functioning; maintain balance among important life domains; and be aware, open, and committed to behaviors that are congruent with deeply held values. In many forms of psychopathology, these Ô¨Çexibility processes are absent. In hopes of creating a more coherent understanding, we synthesize work in emotion regulation, mindfulness and acceptance, social and personality psychology, and neuropsychology. Basic research Ô¨Åndings provide insight into the nature, correlates, and consequences of psychological Ô¨Çexibility and applied research provides details on promising interventions. Throughout, we emphasize dynamic approaches that might capture this Ô¨Çuid construct in the real-world.},

	abstract = {The serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) duloxetine is an effective treatment for major depression and generalised anxiety disorder. Neuropsychological models of antidepressant drug action suggest therapeutic effects might be mediated by the early correction of maladaptive biases in emotion processing, including the recognition of emotional expressions. Sub-chronic administration of duloxetine (for two weeks) produces adaptive changes in neural circuitry implicated in emotion processing; however, its effects on emotional expression recognition are unknown. Forty healthy participants were randomised to receive either 14 days of duloxetine (60 mg/day, titrated from 30 mg after three days) or matched placebo (with sham titration) in a double-blind, between-groups, repeated-measures design. On day 0 and day 14 participants completed a computerised emotional expression recognition task that measured sensitivity to the six primary emotions. Thirty-eight participants (19 per group) completed their course of tablets and were included in the analysis. Results provide evidence that duloxetine, compared to placebo, may reduce the accurate recognition of sadness. Drug effects were driven by changes in participants‚Äô ability to correctly detect subtle expressions of sadness, with greater change observed in the placebo relative to the duloxetine group. These effects occurred in the absence of changes in mood. Our preliminary findings require replication, but complement recent evidence that sadness recognition is a therapeutic target in major depression, and a mechanism through which SNRIs could resolve negative biases in emotion processing to achieve therapeutic effects.},

Emotion dysregulation is a hypothesized contributor to negative outcomes and to the onset of psychopathology during adolescence. However, the dysregulation of negative emotion has been the focus of research while the literature on positive emotion in adolescent psychopathology is limited. This review highlights both the development of normative and dysregulated positive emotion during adolescence. First, the literature on normative adolescent emotional development and on negative emotional regulation is brieÔ¨Çy reviewed, followed by a discussion of current theories of positive emotion, which are grounded in the adult literature. From a developmental perspective, the dimension of approach motivation within positive emotion is emphasized throughout and frames the review. This conceptualization guides organization of literatures on normative experiences of positive emotion in adolescence and the role of dysregulated positive emotion in adolescent psychopathology, speciÔ¨Åcally adolescent depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, externalizing disorders and eating disorders. Last, future directions in the study of adolescent positive emotion and its regulation and the implications of highlighting approach motivation in normative and dysregulated positive emotion in adolescence are detailed.},

	abstract = {Background: Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide and, although efficacious treatments are available, their efficacy is suboptimal and recurrence of symptoms is common. Effective preventive strategies could reduce disability and the long term social and health complications associated with the disorder, but current options are limited. Cognitive bias modification (CBM) is a novel, simple, and safe intervention that addresses attentional and interpretive biases associated with anxiety, dysphoria, and depression. The primary aim of this trial is to determine if CBM decreases the one-year onset of a major depressive episode among adults with subsyndromal depression. Design and methods: This randomised controlled trial will recruit 532 adults with subsyndromal symptoms of depression living in the Australian community (parallel design, 1:1 allocation ratio). Participants will be free of clinically significant symptoms of depression and of psychotic disorders, sensory and cognitive impairment, and risky alcohol use. The CBM intervention will target attentional and interpretive biases associated with depressive symptoms. The sessions will be delivered via the internet over a period of 52 weeks. The primary outcome of interest is the onset of a major depressive episode according the DSM-IV-TR criteria over a 12-month period. Secondary outcomes of interest include change in the severity of depressive symptoms as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), use of antidepressants or benzodiazepines, and changes in attention and interpretive biases. The assessment of outcomes will take place 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after randomisation and will occur via the internet. Discussion: We propose to test the efficacy of an innovative intervention that is well grounded in theory and for which increasing empirical evidence for an effect on mood is available. The intervention is simple, inexpensive, easy to access, and could be easily rolled out into practice if our findings confirm a role for CBM in the prevention of depression.

The current study compared the effectiveness of a newly developed ABM task against the traditional dot-probe ABM task. The new person-identity-matching (PIM) task presented participants with virtual cards, each depicting a happy and angry person. The task encourages selective attention toward or away from threat by requiring participants to make matching judgements between two cards, based either on the identities of the happy faces, or of the angry faces. Change in attentional bias achieved by both ABM tasks was measured by a dot-probe assessment task. Their impact on emotional vulnerability was assessed by measuring negative emotional reactions to a video stressor. The PIM task succeeded in modifying attentional bias, and exerting an impact on emotional reactivity, whereas this was not the case for the dot-probe task. These results are considered in relation to the potential clinical utility of the current task in comparison to traditional ABM methodologies.},

A non-clinical sample of participants was randomly assigned to receive either ABM or a placebo task. To assess pre‚Äìpost changes in attentional control, participants were additionally administered an emotional antisaccade task. ABM participants exhibited a subsequent shift in attentional bias away from threat as expected. ABM participants further showed a subsequent decrease in antisaccade cost, indicating a general facilitation of inhibitory attentional control. Mediational analysis revealed that the shift in attentional bias following ABM was independent to the change in attentional control.

Next, by explicating the processes through which momentary experiences of emotions may accrue into self-perpetuating emotional systems, the current review proposes an underlying architecture of state-trait interactions that engenders lasting affective dispositions. This theoretical framework is then used to elucidate the cognitive‚Äìemotional mechanisms underpinning three disorders of affect regulation: depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia. In turn, two mind training interventions, mindfulness and loving-kindness meditation, are highlighted as means of generating positive emotions that may counter the negative affective processes implicated in these disorders. We conclude with the proposition that positive emotions may exert a countervailing force on the dysphoric, fearful, or anhedonic states characteristic of psychopathologies typiÔ¨Åed by emotional dysfunctions.},

In each training trial, one positive and one neutral word were presented and then a visual target appeared consistently in the location of the positive or neutral words. Participants were instructed to make a simple perceptual discrimination response to the target. Immediately before and after attentional training, participants were exposed to a stress task consisting of viewing a series of extremely negative images while having their eyes tracked. Visual fixation time to negative images, assessed with an eye tracker, served as an indicator of using gaze to successfully regulate emotion. Those participants experimentally trained to selectively attend to affectively positive information looked significantly less at the negative images in the visual stress task following the attentional training, thus demonstrating a learned aversion to negative stimuli. Participants trained toward neutral information did not show this biased gaze pattern.},

This paper presents a questionnaire-based study in healthy young adults for the purpose of exploring individual differences that contribute to the sense of well-being and to identify characteristics of Ô¨Çourishing versus nonÔ¨Çourishing individuals in terms of nonlinear dynamical systems concepts. Methods: Young adult college students (N œ≠ 856) completed questionnaires assessing global well-being (Arizona Integrative Outcomes Scale [AIOS]), global physical health, positive and negative mood (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule [PANAS]), resilience (Connor- Davidson Resilience Scale), and repressive defensiveness. Next, subjects were divided into Ô¨Çourisher/languisher groups by a previously determined ratio of positive/negative scores established by a study using complex systems methods. Results: Positive-to-negative affect (P:N) ratio accounted for more variance in AIOS (R2 œ≠ 0.19; P œΩ .001) than did separate positive or negative PANAS scores or physical health. Flourishers (14.5\% of the sample) were signiÔ¨Åcantly higher than languishers in defensiveness and resilience. Conclusions: Positive-to-negative affect explains a substantial portion of the variance in well-being of healthy young adults. The low percentage of Ô¨Çourishers in this nonclinical sample is consistent with previous population-based studies and suggests that Ô¨Çourishers are a minority, even in nonclinical settings. Positive-to-negative affect may be a useful variable for subsequent prospective studies of applied WSCAM treatments and in well and clinical populations. The well-being measure used in this study is easy to complete, sensitive, and may be a useful clinical measure to track change with treatment over time.},

The present study investigated how emotional biases in memory are related to attentional allocation during retrieval. Forty-nine individuals encoded emotionally positive and negative meanings derived from ambiguous information and then searched their memory for encoded meanings in response to a set of retrieval cues. The remember/know/new procedure was used to classify memories as recollection-based or familiaritybased, and gaze behavior was monitored throughout the task to measure attentional allocation. We found that a bias in sustained attention during recollection-based, but not familiarity-based, retrieval predicted subsequent memory bias toward positive versus negative material following encoding. Thus, during emotional memory retrieval, attention affects controlled forms of retrieval (i.e., recollection) but does not modulate relatively automatic, familiarity-based retrieval. These findings enhance understanding of how distinct components of attention regulate the emotional content of memories. Implications for theoretical models and emotion regulation are discussed.},

	abstract = {Background and objectives: Attentional processes have been suggested to play a crucial role in resilience deÔ¨Åned as positive adaptation facing adversity. However, research is lacking on associations between attentional biases to positive and threat-related stimuli, attentional control and trait resilience.
Methods: Data stem from the follow-up assessment of a longitudinal study investigating mental health and related factors among German soldiers. Trait resilience was assessed with the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale and attentional control with the Attentional Control Scale. A subset of n ¬º 198 soldiers also completed a dot probe task with happy, neutral and threatening faces.
Results: Attentional control was positively related to trait resilience. Results revealed no associations between both attentional biases and trait resilience. However, there was a negative association between attentional bias to threat and trait resilience when attentional control was low and a positive association between attentional bias to threat and trait resilience when attentional control was high. No such associations were found for attentional bias to positive stimuli. Limitations: Generalizability to other populations may be limited since we exclusively focused on male soldiers. Also, the cross-sectional design does not allow for causal conclusions.
Conclusions: Findings suggest that attentional processing may promote trait resilience. Future research on preventive interventions should consider these Ô¨Åndings. ¬© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this article, we review the findings of research examining attention to and memory for negative emotional information using a more dimensional perspective on depression. Specifically, we explore studies that assess cognitive biases along a continuum of depressive symptom severity and consider the influence of co-occurring dimensions of functioning, in particular the severity of anxiety symptoms.

In the positive MIP condition, analyses revealed a mood-congruent relation between positive mood and greater attentional deployment to happy faces.

Furthermore, attentional deployment to happy faces after the negative MIP predicted participants‚Äô mood recovery at the end of the experimental session.

Specifically, we investigated the relationship between pain catastrophizing and attention bias to pain facial expressions. Furthermore, drawing on dual process models in the context of pain, we investigated the moderating role of attention control on this relationship. Adolescents (N 5 73; age, 16-18 years) performed a dot-probe task in which facial expressions of pain and neutral expressions were presented for 100 milliseconds and 1250 milliseconds. Participants also completed self-report pain catastrophizing and attention control measures. We found that although there was no main effect of pain catastrophizing on attention bias towards pain faces, attention control did significantly moderate this relationship. Further analysis revealed that lower levels of attention control were significantly associated with increasing attentional vigilance towards pain faces only within high catastrophizing adolescents. In addition, we found that poorer attention control was related to increased attention bias for pain faces (regardless of pain catastrophizing level) when these faces were presented for relatively longer durations (ie, 1250 milliseconds) but not for short durations (ie, 100 milliseconds). This study supports a dual process model of attentional processes in pain, thus replicating previous findings within the psychopathology literature but extending them to the study of pain.

Moreover, saccades often erroneously went to the location of threat even when a saccade to a different location was required. This implies an automatic shift of attention to a fear-conditioned stimulus that interferes with saccade execution. The same pattern of results was found for a neutral stimulus that was always presented together with the fear-conditioned stimulus and consequently itself became associated with threat.

Previous work suggests that biases in selective attention are associated with both trait negativity and with positive affect states, but to our knowledge, no previous work has explored whether trait-happy individuals attend to the world differently. Here, we employed eye tracking as a continuous measure of sustained overt attention during passive viewing of displays containing positive and neutral photographs to determine whether selective attention to positive scenes is associated with measures of trait happiness and life satisfaction. Both trait measures were significantly correlated with selective attention for positive (vs. neutral) scenes, and this general pattern was robust across several types of positive stimuli (achievement, social, and primary reward), and not because of positive or negative state affect. Such effects were especially prominent during the later phases of sustained viewing. This suggests that people who are happy and satisfied with life may literally see the world in a more positive light, as if through rose-colored glasses. Future work should investigate the causal relationship between such attention biases and one‚Äôs happiness and life satisfaction.},

	abstract = {Emotions can occur during an emotion-eliciting event, but they can also arise when anticipating the event. We used pupillary responses, as a measure of effortful cognitive processing, to test whether the anticipation of an emotional stimulus (positive and negative) inÔ¨Çuences the subsequent online processing of that emotional stimulus. Moreover, we tested whether individual differences in the habitual use of emotion regulation strategies are associated with pupillary responses during the anticipation and/or online processing of this emotional stimulus. Our results show that, both for positive and negative stimuli, pupillary diameter during the anticipation of emotion-eliciting events is inversely and strongly correlated to pupillary responses during the emotional image presentation. The variance in this temporal interplay between anticipation and online processing was related to individual differences in emotion regulation. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the results show that high reappraisal scores are related to larger pupil diameter during the anticipation which is related to smaller pupillary responses during the online processing of emotion-eliciting events. The habitual use of expressive suppression was not associated to pupillary responses in the anticipation and subsequent online processing of emotional stimuli. Taken together, the current data suggest (most strongly for individuals scoring high on the habitual use of reappraisal) that larger pupillary responses during the anticipation of an emotional stimulus are indicative of a sustained attentional set activation to prepare for an upcoming emotional stimulus, which subsequently directs a reduced need to cognitively process that emotional event. Hence, because the habitual use of reappraisal is known to have a positive inÔ¨Çuence on emotional well-being, the interplay between anticipation and online processing of emotional stimuli might be a signiÔ¨Åcant marker of this well-being.},

Using growth curve modeling, we describe trajectories of cumulative risk and promotive factors and test the associations between the time-varying cumulative risk and promotive factor indices and violent behavior. Higher risk was associated with higher levels of violent behavior. Higher levels of promotive factors were associated with less violent behavior and moderated the association between risk and violent behaviors.

Our findings confirm that the ease with which such a threat bias can be transiently evoked by experimental conditions that encourage its acquisition predicts the degree to which trait anxiety later becomes elevated by extended exposure to a mild stressor. Furthermore, this reflects the fact that such early measures of attentional bias plasticity predict the later naturalistic acquisition of attentional bias in response to subsequent stress, which in turn is associated with a consequent increase in trait anxiety level. These findings are consistent with our proposed account of individual differences in susceptibility to elevate trait anxiety in response to stress.},

Second, implicit processes may guide people in selecting suitable emotion regulation strategies, by activating habitual strategies and by tailoring strategies to situational affordances. Third, the implicit processes recruited by habits and implementation intentions may facilitate the enactment of emotion regulation strategies.

Controlling for concurrent life satisfaction, a happiness-induced shift in attention to emotional cues (both threatening and pleasant) was associated with increased levels of later life satisfaction. These results suggest that mood-induced changes in deployment of attention to emotional information may accumulate in ways that impact psychological functioning, yet these effects depend on mood state and the emotional cues afforded by the context.},

	abstract = {Emotion regulation describes how a subject can use certain strategies to aÔ¨Äect emotion response levels. Usually, models for emotion regulation assume mechanisms based on feedback loops that indicate how to change certain aspects of behavior or cognitive functioning in order to get a more satisfactory emotion response level. Adaptation of such feedback loops is usually left out of consideration. This paper introduces an adaptive computational model for emotion regulation by formalizing the model informally described by Gross (1998). The model has been constructed using a high-level modeling language, and integrates both quantitative aspects (such as levels of emotional response) and qualitative aspects (such as decisions to regulate one‚Äôs emotion). This model includes mechanisms for adaptivity of the degree of Ô¨Çexibility of the emotion regulation process. Also, the eÔ¨Äects of events like traumas or therapies on emotion regulation can be simulated. Based on this computational model, a number of simulation experiments have been performed and evaluated. √ì 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In the present study, participants were required to switch between two randomly ordered spatial location tasks in which the position of a target within a 2 √ó 2 grid was determined according to a horizontal or vertical dimension. The typical congruency effect in task switching was replicated such that interference from a currently irrelevant task was associated with slower and inaccurate responses for a currently relevant task. High-ruminators, compared with low-ruminators, displayed poor Ô¨Åltering of the currently irrelevant task which in turn resulted in a speciÔ¨Åc task selection deÔ¨Åcit, and a tendency to perform the irrelevant task. Results suggest that an impaired ability in selecting the appropriate task promoted application of the most salient task regardless of relevance. Our Ô¨Åndings extend previous research linking impaired inhibition of irrelevant information with cognitive inÔ¨Çexibility in dysphoric rumination, and argue for an independent contribution of dysphoric rumination to cognitive deÔ¨Åcits observed in dysphoria.},

Considering the functional links between perception, attention, and action regulation, we posit that when people can avoid the aversive consequences, sensitivity of the perceptual system to danger signals should be enhanced, whereas it should be reduced when there is no such option. To test this prediction, we used a search task in which tachistoscopically presented conjunctions of features had to be detected. Parameters of sensitivity and response bias were analyzed drawing on procedures from signal detection theory. Although the experimental procedure rewarded correct responses, the predicted asymmetry emerged. For stimuli that were linked to a negative consequence (loss of points in the experimental game), perceptual sensitivity was enhanced when participants had the opportunity to neutralize the loss in a second task; an opposite pattern emerged when they had no such opportunity.},

This review presents a dual process model of cognitive vulnerability to unipolar depression. According to dual process theories, humans possess two modes of information processing. An associative mode involves quick, effortless processing that rests on well-learned associations. A reflective mode involves slow, effortful processing that rests on symbolic rule-based inferences. Whereas the associative mode occurs automatically, the reflective mode operates when expectancies are violated and sufficient cognitive resources are available to respond. A cognitive vulnerability to depression is observed when negatively biased associative processing is uncorrected by reflective processing. The circumstances when this is likely to occur are reviewed. New insights and implications for assessment, etiology, and treatment of cognitive vulnerability to depression are discussed.},

The present study used a dual target rapid visual presentation paradigm to examine the temporal allocation of attention to facial expressions of anger and happiness in 16 Palestinian victims of torture with PTSD and 16 control subjects. Findings revealed that signals of threat seem to interfere with already processed information in individuals suffering from PTSD. In contrast, PTSD does not facilitate attention to threatening information. The data provide support for detrimental disengagement as an underlying mechanism of the attentional bias toward threat in PTSD, possibly contributing to symptom development and maintenance.},

Using the challenge‚Äì hindrance stressor framework (Cavanaugh, Boswell, Roehling, \& Boudreau, 2000), we propose that challenge stressors have the potential to promote the capacity for resilience, whereas hindrance stressors experienced in the workplace erode resilient functioning. Employing a 2-wave longitudinal design we examined the effects of challenge and hindrance stressors on psychological resilience and strain 3 months later. Two-hundred and 8 working adults (48.1\% female) participated in both surveys. Findings indicated that Time 1 challenge stressors had a significant effect on psychological resilience 3 months later (Time 2). In contrast, Time 1 hindrance stressors positively predicted Time 2 strain and negatively predicted psychological resilience. Moreover, resilience mediated the relationship between Time 1 stressors and Time 2 strain. These results demonstrate the potential positive and negative impacts of workplace stressor types on psychological resilience, and provide an exploration of a mechanism through which challenge and hindrance stressors influence well-being. This analysis also investigated the role of resilience in moderating the relationship between hindrances and strain. Some evidence emerged for the moderating role of resilience in the hindrance‚Äìstrain relationship. The implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.},

	abstract = {The efÔ¨Åcacy of interventions might be underestimated or even go undetected as a main effect when it is hidden in gene-by-environment (G √ó E) interactions. This review moves beyond the problems thwarting correlational G √ó E research to propose genetic differential susceptibility experiments. G √ó E experiments can test the bright side as well as the dark side of the moderating role of genotypes traditionally considered to represent vulnerability to negative conditions. The differential susceptibility model predicts that carriers of these risk genotypes proÔ¨Åt most from interventions changing the environment for the better. The evolutionary background of G √ó E and differential susceptibility is discussed, and statistical methods for the analysis of differential susceptibility (versus diathesis stress) are reviewed. Then, based on results from 22 randomized G √ó E experiments, meta-analytic evidence for the differential susceptibility model is presented. Intervention effects are much stronger in the susceptible genotypes than in the nonsusceptible genotypes. The Ô¨Ånal sections suggest possibilities to broaden the G component in the G √ó E equation by including genetic pathways, and to broaden the E component by including methylation level and gene expression as promising ways to probe the concept of the environment more deeply and address the perennial issue of what works for whom.},

However, such ‚Äúrisk‚Äù variants are surprisingly frequent in the population. Evolutionary analysis suggests that genetic variants associated with increased risk for maladaptive development under adverse environmental conditions are maintained in the population because they are also associated with advantages in response to different contextual conditions. These advantages may include (a) coexisting genetic resilience pertaining to other adverse inÔ¨Çuences, (b) a general genetic susceptibility to both low and high environmental quality, and (c) a coexisting propensity to beneÔ¨Åt disproportionately from positive and supportive exposures, as reÔ¨Çected in the recent framework of vantage sensitivity. After introducing the basic properties of vantage sensitivity and highlighting conceptual similarities and differences with diathesis-stress and differential susceptibility patterns of gene‚Äìenvironment interaction, selected and recent empirical evidence for the notion of vantage sensitivity as a function of genetic differences is reviewed. The unique contribution that the new perspective of vantage sensitivity may make to our understanding of social inequality will be discussed after suggesting neurocognitive and molecular mechanisms hypothesized to underlie the propensity to beneÔ¨Åt disproportionately from benevolent experiences.},

Patients were randomly assigned to either an attention training condition (n œ≠ 18), in which patients completed a modified dot-probe task designed to facilitate attentional disengagement from disgusted faces, or a control dot-probe task condition (n œ≠ 18). As predicted, patients in the attention training condition exhibited significantly greater reductions in social anxiety and trait anxiety, compared with patients in the control condition. At termination, 72\% of patients in the active treatment condition, relative to 11\% of patients in the control condition, no longer met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.) criteria for SAD. At 4-month follow-up, patients in the attention training condition continued to maintain their clinical improvement, and diagnostic differences across conditions were also maintained.

The goal of this study is to investigate whether adaptive and/or maladaptive emotion regulation strategies moderate the relationship between dysfunctional attitudes and depressive symptoms under stress.
Methods: In a longitudinal study, 92 healthy but unselected undergraduates were followed for three months including a stress period (four weeks of examinations).
Results: Our Ô¨Åndings demonstrate that the more adaptive emotion regulation strategies are used in daily life (measured at baseline), the weaker the relationship between dysfunctional attitudes and depressive symptoms during stress. Interestingly, no single strategy demonstrates a unique predictive value, but only the combination of several adaptive strategies moderates the relationship between dysfunctional attitudes and depressive symptoms. Although participants with elevated depressive symptoms use more maladaptive emotion regulation strategies, these latter strategies do not moderate the association between dysfunctional attitudes and depressive symptoms. Limitations: The use of a sample of undergraduates limits the generalizability and the clinical signiÔ¨Åcance of our results.
Conclusions: Altogether, although dysfunctional attitudes are activated and accessible in response to certain life stressors, the strategies that healthy individuals use to adaptively regulate these cognitions seem important in determining the likelihood of depressive symptoms.},

Whereas voluntary attention was directed to evaluators who expressed praise, attention was drawn to one‚Äôs own picture after criticism. Pupil dilation and heart-rate variability were larger in response to criticism as compared to praise, suggesting a flexible and adaptive emotion regulatory effort in response to social information that triggers an affective response.

	doi = {10.1017/S0033291714002013},
	abstract = {Background. Military training is a chronic stressful period that often induces stress-related psychopathology. Stress vulnerability and resilience depend on personality trait anxiety, attentional threat bias and prefrontal‚Äìlimbic dysfunction. However, how these neurobehavioral elements interact with regard to the development of symptoms following stress remains unclear.
Method. Fifty-Ô¨Åve healthy combat soldiers undergoing intensive military training completed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) testing while performing the dot-probe task (DPT) composed of angry (threat) and neutral faces. Participants were then stratiÔ¨Åed according to their bias tendency to avoidance (n = 25) or vigilance (n = 30) groups, categorized as high or low trait anxiety and assessed for post-stress symptom severity.
Results. Avoidance compared to vigilance tendency was associated with fewer post-trauma symptoms and increased hippocampal response to threat among high anxious but not low anxious individuals. Importantly, mediation analysis revealed that only among high anxious individuals did hippocampal activity lead to lower levels of symptoms through avoidance bias tendency. However, in the whole group, avoidance bias was modulated by the interplay between the hippocampus and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC).
Conclusions. Our results provide a neurobehavioral model to explain the resilience to post-trauma symptoms following chronic exposure. The model points to the importance of considering threat bias tendency in addition to personality traits when investigating the brain response and symptoms of trauma. Such a multi-parametric approach that accounts for individual behavioral sensitivities may also improve brain-driven treatments of anxiety, possibly by targeting the interplay between the hippocampus and the dACC.},

In this study, we examined whether stressor controllability modulates subsequent conditioned fear expression in humans. Participants were randomly assigned to an escapable stressor condition, a yoked inescapable stressor condition, or a control condition involving no stress exposure. One week later, all participants underwent fear conditioning, fear extinction, and a test of extinction retrieval the following day. Participants exposed to inescapable stress showed impaired fear extinction learning and increased fear expression the following day. In contrast, escapable stress improved fear extinction and prevented the spontaneous recovery of fear. Consistent with the bidirectional controllability effects previously reported in animal models, these results suggest that one‚Äôs degree of control over aversive experiences may be an important factor inÔ¨Çuencing the development of psychological resilience or vulnerability in humans.},

However, it remains unclear whether CCT can also be implemented as a preventive intervention for depression, increasing resilience. For this purpose, at-risk undergraduate students (high trait ruminators) were allocated to a CCT or active control condition, consisting of 10 online training sessions. Working memory functioning was assessed preceding and following the training and reactivity to a lab stressor was assessed directly following training. Finally, at four weeks follow-up, brooding e the maladaptive form of rumination e was re-assessed in response to a naturalistic stressor (examination period). Although we did not Ô¨Ånd direct transfer effects of CCT on working memory functioning, increase in working memory functioning following CCT was related to post-training brooding and resilience levels. Moreover, participants receiving CCT demonstrated lower stress reactivity in the lab and a decrease in brooding following a naturalistic stressor at follow-up, indicating temporal stability of our Ô¨Åndings. These Ô¨Åndings suggest that CCT can be considered a promising preventive intervention to reduce stress reactivity and rumination.},

The broaden-and-build theory suggests that this is because positive emotions help people build lasting resources. To test this hypothesis, the authors measured emotions daily for 1 month in a sample of students (N œ≠ 86) and assessed life satisfaction and trait resilience at the beginning and end of the month. Positive emotions predicted increases in both resilience and life satisfaction. Negative emotions had weak or null effects and did not interfere with the benefits of positive emotions. Positive emotions also mediated the relation between baseline and final resilience, but life satisfaction did not. This suggests that it is in-the-moment positive emotions, and not more general positive evaluations of one‚Äôs life, that form the link between happiness and desirable life outcomes. Change in resilience mediated the relation between positive emotions and increased life satisfaction, suggesting that happy people become more satisfied not simply because they feel better but because they develop resources for living well.},

Drawing participants from higher-income and lower-income backgrounds, we tested how adults who grew up in harsh or unpredictable environments fared on 2 types of executive function tasks: inhibition and shifting. People who experienced unpredictable childhoods performed worse at inhibition (overriding dominant responses), but performed better at shifting (efficiently switching between different tasks). This finding is consistent with the notion that shifting, but not inhibition, is especially useful in unpredictable environments. Importantly, differences in executive function between people who experienced unpredictable versus predictable childhoods emerged only when they were tested in uncertain contexts. This catalyst suggests that some individual differences related to early life experience are manifested under conditions of uncertainty in adulthood. Viewed as a whole, these findings indicate that adverse childhood environments do not universally impair mental functioning, but can actually enhance specific types of cognitive performance in the face of uncertainty.},

The mechanisms mediating these relations, however, are poorly understood. We examined the relation between exposure to ELS and reward-related brain activity, which is known to predict motivation and mood, at age 26, in a sample followed since kindergarten with annual assessments. Using functional neuroimaging, we assayed individual differences in the activity of the ventral striatum (VS) during the processing of monetary rewards associated with a simple card-guessing task, in a sample of 72 male participants. We examined associations between a cumulative measure of ELS exposure and VS activity in adulthood. We found that greater levels of cumulative stress during childhood and adolescence predicted lower reward-related VS activity in adulthood. Extending this general developmental pattern, we found that exposure to stress early in development (between kindergarten and grade 3) was significantly associated with variability in adult VS activity. Our results provide an important demonstration that cumulative life stress, especially during this childhood period, is associated with blunted reward-related VS activity in adulthood. These differences suggest neurobiological pathways through which a history of ELS may contribute to reduced motivation and increased negative mood.},

Participants included 60 healthy undergraduate students who completed measures of psychopathology, self-reported emotional experience, and an emotional Stroop task designed to measure attentional bias to positive and negative emotional information. Results indicate significant associations between reaction times for high-intensity happiness words and self-reported high levels of positive emotion and low levels of negative emotions. These associations were not present for low intensity happiness words. Findings suggest that individuals who experience high levels of positive emotion and low levels of negative emotion demonstrate an attention bias for positive information and, from an information processing perspective, provide insight into the manner in which positive emotions broaden cognitive processes.},

The current study was designed to explore if executive control, speciÔ¨Åcally task switching, can be trained in adolescents, what particular aspects of executive control may underlie training and transfer effects, and if acute bouts of exercise directly prior to cognitive training enhance training effects. For that purpose, a task switching training was employed that has been shown to be effective in other age groups. A group of adolescents (10‚Äì14 years, n = 20) that received a three-session task switching training was compared to a group (n = 20) that received the same task switching training but who exercised on a stationary bike before each training session. Additionally, a no-contact and an exercise only control group were included (both ns = 20). Analyses indicated that both training groups signiÔ¨Åcantly reduced their switching costs over the course of the training sessions for reaction times and error rates, respectively. Analyses indicated transfer to mixing costs in a task switching task that was similar to the one used in training. Far transfer was limited to a choice reaction time task and a tendency for faster reaction times in an updating task. Analyses revealed no additional effects of the exercise intervention. Findings thus indicate that executive control can be enhanced in adolescents through training and that updating may be of particular relevance for the effects of task switching training.},

This study investigated whether brain-training (working memory [WM] training) improves cognitive functions beyond the training task (transfer effects), especially regarding the control of emotional material since it constitutes much of the information we process daily. Forty-five participants received WM training using either emotional or neutral material, or an undemanding control task. WM training, regardless of training material, led to transfer gains on another WM task and in fluid intelligence. However, only brain-training with emotional material yielded transferable gains to improved control over affective information on an emotional Stroop task. The data support the reality of transferable benefits of demanding WM training and suggest that transferable gains across to affective contexts require training with material congruent to those contexts. These findings constitute preliminary evidence that intensive cognitively demanding brain-training can improve not only our abstract problem-solving capacity, but also ameliorate cognitive control processes (e.g. decision-making) in our daily emotive environments.},

	abstract = {Working memory (WM), the ability to store and manipulate information for short periods of time, is an important predictor of scholastic aptitude and a critical bottleneck underlying higher-order cognitive processes, including controlled attention and reasoning. Recent interventions targeting WM have suggested plasticity of the WM system by demonstrating improvements in both trained and untrained WM tasks. However, evidence on transfer of improved WM into more general cognitive domains such as fluid intelligence (Gf) has been more equivocal. Therefore, we conducted a metaanalysis focusing on one specific training program, n-back. We searched PubMed and Google Scholar for all n-back training studies with Gf outcome measures, a control group, and healthy participants between 18 and 50 years of age. In total, we included 20 studies in our analyses that met our criteria and found a small but significant positive effect of nback training on improving Gf. Several factors that moderate this transfer are identified and discussed. We conclude that short-term cognitive training on the order of weeks can result in beneficial effects in important cognitive functions as measured by laboratory tests.},

First, natural selection may favor risky strategies that enhance fitness on average but which have detrimental consequences for a subset of individuals. Second, mismatch may result when organisms experience environmental change during ontogeny, for instance, because they move from one environment to another. Third, organisms may learn about their environment in order to develop an appropriate phenotype; when cues indicate the environmental state probabilistically, as opposed to deterministically, sampling processes may produce mismatch. For each source of maladaptation, we present a selection of the relevant empirical research and illustrate how models from evolutionary biology can be used to make predictions about maladaptation. We also discuss what data can be collected to test these models in humans. Our goal is to show that evolutionary approaches not only yield insights into adaptive outcomes but can also illuminate the conditions leading to maladaptation. This perspective provides additional nuance to the dialectic between the developmental psychopathology model and evolutionary developmental psychology.},

The evolutionary model contends that understanding the evolutionary functions of adolescence is critical to explaining why adolescents engage in risky behavior and that successful intervention depends on working with, instead of against, adolescent goals and motivations. The current article articulates 5 key evolutionary insights into risky adolescent behavior: (a) The adolescent transition is an inflection point in development of social status and reproductive trajectories; (b) interventions need to address the adaptive functions of risky and aggressive behaviors like bullying; (c) risky adolescent behavior adaptively calibrates over development to match both harsh and unpredictable environmental conditions; (d) understanding evolved sex differences is critical for understanding the psychology of risky behavior; and (e) mismatches between current and past environments can dysregulate adolescent behavior, as demonstrated by age-segregated social groupings. The evolutionary model has broad implications for designing interventions for high-risk youth and suggests new directions for research that have not been forthcoming from other perspectives.},

This study tested the hypothesis that this attentional focus toward mother occurs at the expense of attentional exploration of the environment. Ninety children, aged 8 ‚Äì12, completed questionnaires assessing trust in maternal support, watched a video that induced mild fear of dogs, and completed a dot probe computer task assessing attentional processing of simultaneously presented pictures of mother and pictures of the threatening stimulus (i.e., dogs). Less trust in maternal support was linked to a stronger attentional focus toward the mother pictures versus the dog pictures. These results suggest that, in the presence of mother, children with more secure attachment expectations are better able to freely explore a mildly threatening environment.},

A recent theory claims that this component of attention is specifically related to ruminative thought. To further investigate this claim we report two new experiments using the internal shift task (IST). In experiment 1 (N=27) we examined the stability of switching ability measured using the IST through examination of internal consistency (stability within the task) and test-retest-reliability (stability over time) over two weeks. Results indicate relatively high stability of switching ability measured with the IST. In experiment 2 the IST was administered to a pre-selected undergraduate sample of high (N=20) and low ruminators (N=20). The main findings were that rumination was related to attentional switching impairments, specifically in the context of emotional information. The switching impairments were most pronounced when negative information was held in working memory. The attentional switching impairments were most strongly related to the depressive brooding component of rumination. The results of this study lend further support to the proposed link between rumination and switching abilities.},

Behavioral results showed that while learning performance was balanced between the two groups, participants in the positive mood group had a higher learning rate than participants in the neutral mood group. At the electrophysiological level, we found that positive mood increased the error-related negativity when the stimulus‚Äìresponse associations were deterministic, selectively (as opposed to random or probabilistic).

Method: We used an affective modification of the negative priming task. If interference is related to enhanced inhibition, reduced interference from negative stimuli and a related weakened inhibition towards negative stimuli in the elderly group would be in line with the positivity hypothesis. Results: As expected, the results indicated that interference from negative stimuli was significantly lower in older adults as compared to younger adults, whereas this was not the case for positive stimuli. Moreover, at inhibitory level a significantly reduced processing of negative stimuli was observed only in the older adult group, whereas there was no such effect in the case of positive material.},

We consider whether child development has no impact on information processing biases to threat (integral bias model), or whether child development inÔ¨Çuences information processing biases and if so whether it does so by moderating the expression of an existing bias (moderation model) or by affecting the acquisition of a bias (acquisition model). We examine the extent to which these models Ô¨Åt with existing theory and research evidence and outline some methodological issues that need to be considered when drawing conclusions about the potential role of child development in the information processing of threat stimuli.

	abstract = {Background‚ÄîAttention Bias Modification Treatment (ABMT) is a newly-emerging promising treatment for anxiety disorders. While recent randomized control trials (RCTs) suggest that ABMT reduces anxiety, therapeutic effects have not been summarized quantitatively.
Methods‚ÄîStandard meta-analytic procedures were used to summarize the effect of ABMT on anxiety. Using MEDLINE, January 1995 to February 2010, we identified RCTs comparing the effects on anxiety of ABMT and quantified effect sizes using Hedge‚Äôs d.
Results‚ÄîTwelve studies met inclusion criteria, including 467 participants from 10 publications. ABMT produced significantly greater reductions in anxiety than control training, with a medium effect (d = 0.61, p {\textless}.001). Age and gender did not moderate the effect of ABMT on anxiety, while several characteristics of the ABMT training did.
Conclusions‚ÄîABMT shows promise as a novel treatment for anxiety. Additional RCTs are needed to fully evaluate the degree to which these findings replicate and apply to patients. Future work should consider the precise role for ABMT in the broader anxiety-disorder therapeutic armamentarium.},

In this meta-analysis, we assessed the efÔ¨Åcacy of ABM for SAD on symptoms, reactivity to speech challenge, attentional bias (AB) toward threat, and secondary symptoms at posttraining as well as SAD symptoms at 4-month follow-up. A systematic search in bibliographical databases uncovered 15 randomized studies involving 1043 individuals that compared ABM to a control training procedure. Data were extracted independently by two raters. The Q statistic was used to assess homogeneity across trials. All analyses were conducted on intent-totreat data. ABM produced a small but signiÔ¨Åcant reduction in SAD symptoms (g = 0.27), reactivity to speech challenge (g = 0.46), and AB (g = 0.30). These effects were moderated by characteristics of the ABM procedure, the design of the study, and trait anxiety at baseline. However, effects on secondary symptoms (g = 0.09) and SAD symptoms at 4-month follow-up (g = 0.09) were not signiÔ¨Åcant. Although there was no indication of signiÔ¨Åcant publication bias, the quality of the studies was substandard and wedged the effect sizes. From a clinical point of view, these Ô¨Åndings imply that ABM is not yet ready for wide-scale dissemination as a treatment for SAD in routine care. Theoretical implications for the integration of AB in the conceptualization of SAD are discussed.},

	abstract = {The current meta-analysis explores the strength of effects of cognitive bias modification training for interpretation bias (CBM-I) on positive (i.e., adaptive) interpretations and mood as well as the training and sample characteristics influencing these effects. Data-bases were searched with the key words ‚Äò‚Äòinterpret* bias AND training‚Äô‚Äô and ‚Äò‚Äòinterpret* bias AND modif*‚Äô‚Äô. Reference lists of identified articles were checked and authors of identified articles were contacted for further relevant articles and unpublished data. Studies were reviewed for inclusion with eligibility criteria being that the study (a) aimed to target interpretation biases through any kind of training, (b) assessed mood and/or interpretation bias as outcome measures, (c) allocated individuals to training conditions at random, and (d) recruited adult samples. A meta-analytic multilevel mixed-effects model was employed to assess standardized mean changes in interpretation bias, negative mood, and emotional reactivity. In addition, several training and sample characteristics were explored for their potential to enhance benign training effectiveness. On average, benign CBM-I resulted in an increase in positive interpretation bias (p, .01) and a decrease in negative mood state (p,.001), but did not affect emotional reactivity. These effects were not consistently different from control conditions with no or neutral training. However, within benign training conditions imagery instructions and more training sessions were related to larger cognitive and mood effects, whereas feedback about training performance and inclusion of non-benign training items (instead of including benign items only) boosted cognitive effects only. Finally, training was more effective in women (cognitive and mood effects) and presumably samples with symptomatic emotional dysregulation (cognitive effects). Although the effects of emotional dysregulation and number of training sessions could not well be distinguished, there is an indication that when used with imagery instructions and more training sessions, benign CBM-I can be employed as a useful complementary treatment to usual psychotherapies.},

	abstract = {Executive functions (EFs) include a number of higher-level cognitive control abilities, such as cognitive Ô¨Çexibility, inhibition, and working memory, which are instrumental in supporting action control and the Ô¨Çexible adaptation changing environments. These control functions are supported by the prefrontal cortex and therefore develop rapidly across childhood and mature well into late adolescence. Given that executive control is a strong predictor for various life outcomes, such as academic achievement, socioeconomic status, and physical health, numerous training interventions have been designed to improve executive functioning across the lifespan, many of them targeting children and adolescents. Despite the increasing popularity of these trainings, their results are neither robust nor consistent, and the transferability of training-induced performance improvements to untrained tasks seems to be limited. In this review, we provide a selective overview of the developmental literature on process-based cognitive interventions by discussing (1) the concept and the development of EFs and their neural underpinnings, (2) the effects of different types of executive control training in normally developing children and adolescents, (3) individual differences in training-related performance gains as well as (4) the potential of cognitive training interventions for the application in clinical and educational contexts. Based on recent Ô¨Åndings, we consider how transfer of process-based executive control trainings may be supported and how interventions may be tailored to the needs of speciÔ¨Åc age groups or populations.},

Computerized cognitive training (CCT) paradigms offer potential to improve cognition, mood and everyday functioning, but their effectiveness is not well established. The goal of this article was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the efÔ¨Åcacy of CCT in depressive disorders.
Method: A search was conducted to identify high quality randomized controlled CCT trials per PRISMA guidelines using PsycINFO and MEDLINE with the keywords ‚ÄúCognitive training‚Äù or ‚ÄúCognitive remediation‚Äù or ‚ÄúCognitive rehabilitation‚Äù and ‚ÄúDepression‚Äù. 9 randomized trials for depressed adults met inclusion criteria. Effect sizes (Hedge's g) were calculated for key outcome measures of mood symptom severity, daily functioning, and cognition. A 3-level Bayesian hierarchical linear model was used to estimate effect sizes for each domain and study. Publication bias was assessed using Classic Fail Safe N's and homogeneity was evaluated using Q and I2 indexes.
Results: SigniÔ¨Åcant small-moderate effects for Symptom Severity (0.43) and Daily Functioning (0.72), and moderate-large effects for Attention (0.67), Working Memory (0.72), and Global Functioning (1.05) were found. No signiÔ¨Åcant effects were found for Executive Functioning or Verbal Memory. Moderator variable analysis revealed decreased effect of CCT with age. Gender and concurrent medication treatment did not affect the results. Limitations: Small sample size, short duration, pseudo-speciÔ¨Åcity, and high heterogeneity for Verbal Memory measures.
Conclusions: CCT is associated with improvement in depressive symptoms and everyday functioning, though produces inconsistent effects on cognition.},

Results showed that this meditation practice produced increases over time in daily experiences of positive emotions, which, in turn, produced increases in a wide range of personal resources (e.g., increased mindfulness, purpose in life, social support, decreased illness symptoms). In turn, these increments in personal resources predicted increased life satisfaction and reduced depressive symptoms. Discussion centers on how positive emotions are the mechanism of change for the type of mind-training practice studied here and how loving-kindness meditation is an intervention strategy that produces positive emotions in a way that outpaces the hedonic treadmill effect.},

Regression analyses tested whether positive affect predicted successful and unsuccessful adaptation to stress (viz., resilience and burnout, respectively) after controlling for demographic characteristics and work stress. Positive affect was largely correlated with resilience (r = .65, p {\textbackslash} .001) and burnout (r = -.57, p {\textbackslash} .001). The regression of resilience showed that positive affect had a direct effect (b = .66, p {\textbackslash} .001) and the total model explained 44 \% of the variance (R2 Change = 37 \%). In the regression of burnout, positive affect also had a direct effect (b = -.41, p {\textbackslash} .001) and the total model explained 52 \% of the variance (R2 Change = 14 \%). Further analyses found no signiÔ¨Åcant interaction between work stress and positive affect, but revealed that positive affect completely mediated the effect of work stress on resilience. Results provide support for the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions, particularly the theory‚Äôs building and undoing effects.},

	abstract = {The notion that some people are more vulnerable to adversity as a function of inherent risk characteristics is widely embraced in most fields of psychology. This is reflected in the popularity of the diathesis-stress framework, which has received a vast amount of empirical support over the years. Much less effort has been directed toward the investigation of endogenous factors associated with variability in response to positive influences. One reason for the failure to investigate individual differences in response to positive experiences as a function of endogenous factors may be the absence of adequate theoretical frameworks. According to the differential-susceptibility hypothesis, individuals generally vary in their developmental plasticity regardless of whether they are exposed to negative or positive influences‚Äîa notion derived from evolutionary reasoning. On the basis of this now well-supported proposition, we advance herein the new concept of vantage sensitivity, reflecting variation in response to exclusively positive experiences as a function of individual endogenous characteristics. After distinguishing vantage sensitivity from theoretically related concepts of differential-susceptibility and resilience, we review some recent empirical evidence for vantage sensitivity featuring behavioral, physiological, and genetic factors as moderators of a wide range of positive experiences ranging from family environment and psychotherapy to educational intervention. Thereafter, we discuss genetic and environmental factors contributing to individual differences in vantage sensitivity, potential mechanisms underlying vantage sensitivity, and practical implications.},

	abstract = {Although earlier studies have related positive emotions to attentional broadening, recent Ô¨Åndings point out the complexity of this relation and show that these broadening effects interact with factors such as characteristics of the information that is presented. Besides stimuli characteristics, individual characteristics such as the presence of depressive symptoms could also inÔ¨Çuence the broadening effects as depressive symptoms have previously been related to a more narrow attentional scope. Therefore, the aim of this study was to further investigate the attentional broadening effects of positive emotions, testing whether this is inÔ¨Çuenced by the emotional valence of the information presented and secondly, how the presence of depressive symptoms might interact with this relationship. We used a performance-based measure to assess Ô¨Çuctuations in attentional broadening for positive, neutral, and negative stimuli. We assessed the presence and severity of depressive symptoms in an unselected study sample and tested whether these symptoms moderate the relationship between induced positive mood and attentional breadth for emotional information. Results showed no direct relation between positive mood and attentional breadth, regardless of the emotional valence of the stimuli. However, the presence of depressive symptoms moderated this relationship in such a way that among low levels of depressive symptoms, positive mood was related to attentional broadening speciÔ¨Åcally when positive information was presented, while at high levels of depressive symptoms this relation was reversed. The current Ô¨Åndings suggest that both stimuli characteristics, individual characteristics and their interplay should be taken into account when investigating the broadening effects of positive emotions.},

	abstract = {Efficient detection of threat provides obvious survival advantages and has resulted in a fast and accurate threatdetection system. Although beneficial under normal circumstances, this system may become hypersensitive and cause threat-processing abnormalities. Past research has shown that anxious individuals have difficulty disengaging attention from threatening faces, but it is unknown whether other forms of threatening social stimuli also influence attentional orienting. Much like faces, human body postures are salient social stimuli, because they are informative of one‚Äôs emotional state and next likely action. Additionally, postures can convey such information in situations in which another‚Äôs facial expression is not easily visible. Here we investigated whether there is a threat-specific effect for high-anxious individuals, by measuring the time that it takes the eyes to leave the attended stimulus, a task-irrelevant body posture. The results showed that relative to nonthreating postures, threat-related postures hold attention in anxious individuals, providing further evidence of an anxiety-related attentional bias for threatening information. This is the first study to demonstrate that attentional disengagement from threatening postures is affected by emotional valence in those reporting anxiety.},

The present dual-task study examined whether this eÔ¨Äect generalizes to the random task cuing paradigm. Participants performed color or shape judgments according to explicit word cues (COLOR or SHAPE) or less transparent letter cues (C for the color task and S for the shape task). In the word cue condition, the switch cost was equivalent for the articulatory suppression and the control (no dual-task) conditions, but, in the letter cue condition, the switch cost was significantly greater for the articulatory suppression condition than for the control condition. These results suggest that inner speech may be recruited as a tool for retrieving and activating the relevant task goal when the task cue is not transparent and hence imposes nonnegligible retrieval demand.},

	abstract = {Anxiety prepares an organism for dealing with threats by recruiting cognitive resources to process information about the threat, and by engaging physiological systems to prepare a response. Heightened trait anxiety is associated with biases in both these processes: high trait-anxious individuals tend to report heightened risk perceptions, and inappropriate engagement in danger mitigation behavior. However, no research has addressed whether the calibration between risk perception and danger mitigation behavior is affected by anxiety, though it is well recognized that this calibration is crucial for adaptive functioning. The current study aimed to examine whether anxiety is characterized by better or worse calibration of danger mitigation behavior to variations in risk magnitude. Low and high trait-anxious participants were presented with information about the likelihood and severity of a danger (loud noise burst) on each trial. Participants could decide to mitigate this danger by investing a virtual coin, at the cost of losing danger mitigation ability on subsequent trials. Importantly, level of risk likelihood and severity were varied independently, and the multiplicative relationship between the 2 defined total danger. Multilevel modeling showed that the magnitude of total danger predicted the probability of coin investments, over and above the effects of risk likelihood and severity, suggesting that participants calibrated their danger mitigation behavior to integrated risk information. Crucially, this calibration was affected by trait anxiety, indicating better calibration in high trait-anxious individuals. These results are discussed in light of existing knowledge and models of the effect of anxiety on risk perception and decision-making.},

In experiment 2 we investigated the same attentional training procedure in a sample of depressed in- and outpatients (N = 35). Mild improvements on symptom severity were observed in students showing mild depressive symptoms. However, in students showing moderate to severe depressive symptoms, depressive symptoms increased after the training. No beneficial effects of training on top of therapy and/or medication were found in depressed patients.

	abstract = {The past decade has witnessed an exponential growth in studies that have attempted to identify the genetic polymporphisms that moderate the influence of environmental risks on mental disorders. What tends to be neglected in these Gene√Ç Environment (G√Ç E) interaction studies has been a focus on resilience, which refers to a dynamic pattern of positive adaptation despite the experience of a significant trauma or adversity. In this article, we argue that one step toward advancing the field of developmental psychopathology would be for G √Ç E research to consider resilience instead of focusing almost exclusively on mental disorders. After providing an up-to-date summary on the expanding definitions and models of resilience, and the available evidence regarding measured G √Ç E studies of childhood maltreatment, we discuss why resilience would be a worthwhile phenotype for studies of measured G √Ç E. First, although G √Ç E hypotheses require that there be an environmental risk (e-risk) involved in a causal process that leads to psychopathology, e-risks are typically not included in the diagnostic criteria for most psychiatric disorders. In contrast, resilience by definition includes an e-risk. Second, G√ÇE hypotheses require that there is evidence of variability in response to an environmental stressor, and resilience often represents the positive end on this continuum of adaptation. Third, both resilience and G √Ç E are best understood from a developmental perspective. Fourth, although resilient outcomes are not public health concerns, the types of adversities (e.g., childhood maltreatment, poverty, or exposure to natural disasters) that are often investigated in studies of resilience certainly are. Understanding how some individuals, perhaps because of their genetic makeup, are able to withstand such adversities can inform prevention and intervention efforts to improve mental health.},

	abstract = {The well-replicated observation that many people maintain mental health despite exposure to severe psychological or physical adversity has ignited interest in the mechanisms that protect against stress-related mental illness. Focusing on resilience rather than pathophysiology in many ways represents a paradigm shift in clinical-psychological and psychiatric research that has great potential for the development of new prevention and treatment strategies. More recently, research into resilience also arrived in the neurobiological community, posing nontrivial questions about ecological validity and translatability. Drawing on concepts and Ô¨Åndings from transdiagnostic psychiatry, emotion research, and behavioral and cognitive neuroscience, we propose a uniÔ¨Åed theoretical framework for the neuroscientiÔ¨Åc study of general resilience mechanisms. The framework is applicable to both animal and human research and supports the design and interpretation of translational studies. The theory emphasizes the causal role of stimulus appraisal (evaluation) processes in the generation of emotional responses, including responses to potential stressors. On this basis, it posits that a positive (non-negative) appraisal style is the key mechanism that protects against the detrimental effects of stress and mediates the effects of other known resilience factors. Appraisal style is shaped by three classes of cognitive processes ‚Äì positive situation classiÔ¨Åcation, reappraisal, and interference inhibition ‚Äì that can be investigated at the neural level. Prospects for the future development of resilience research are discussed.},

	abstract = {The broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions suggests that positive emotions can widen the range of potential coping strategies that come to mind and subsequently enhance one‚Äôs resilience against stress. Studies have shown that high stress, especially chronic levels of stress, strongly contributes to the development of anxiety and depressive symptoms. However, researchers have also found that individuals who possess high levels of resilience are protected from stress and thus report lower levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Using a sample of 200 postdoctoral research fellows, the present study examined if (a) positive emotions were associated with greater resilience, (b) coping strategies mediated the link between positive emotions and resilience and (c) resilience moderated the inÔ¨Çuence of stress on trait anxiety and depressive symptoms. Results support the broaden-and-build theory in that positive emotions may enhance resilience directly as well as indirectly through the mediating role of coping strategies‚Äîparticularly via adaptive coping. Resilience also moderated the association of stress with trait anxiety and depressive symptoms. Although stress is unavoidable and its inÔ¨Çuences on anxiety and depressive symptoms are undeniable, the likelihood of postdocs developing anxiety or depressive symptoms may be reduced by implementing programmes designed to increase positive emotions, adaptive coping strategies and resilience.

This literature falls short of addressing whether the effects of CBM-I extend to worries about a real-life stressor, such as a school transition. Design: The study comprised a between-groups design comparing the effects of CBM-I to an active control (AC) intervention in children. Method: We recruited 38 children within two months of their primary‚Äìsecondary school transition and investigated the capacity for multisession, parent-administered CBM-I, compared to an AC condition, to modify cognitive style and reduce anxiety symptoms and school concerns. Results: While benign interpretations increased signiÔ¨Åcantly and negative interpretations tended to decrease following CBM-I, both interventions signiÔ¨Åcantly reduced anxiety symptoms and school concerns. Conclusions: These Ô¨Åndings indicate that anxiety-reducing effects of CBM-I in children extend to a real life stressful event, but that equivalent anxiety reduction may be achieved through exposure to potentially worrying situations and parent‚Äìchild interaction in the absence of bias modiÔ¨Åcation.},

	abstract = {Background: Individuals in remission from depression are at increased risk for developing future depressive episodes. Several cognitive risk- and resilience factors have been suggested to account for this vulnerability. In the current study we explored how risk- and protective factors such as cognitive control, adaptive and maladaptive emotion regulation, residual symptomatology, and resilience relate to one another in a remitted depressed (RMD) sample.
Methods: We examined the relationships between these constructs in a cross-sectional dataset of 69 RMD patients using network analyses in order to obtain a comprehensive, data-driven view on the interplay between these constructs. We subsequently present an association network, a concentration network, and a relative importance network.
Results: In all three networks resilience formed the central hub, connecting perceived cognitive control (i.e., working memory complaints), emotion regulation, and residual symptomatology. The contribution of the behavioral measure for cognitive control in the network was negligible. Moreover, the directed relative importance network indicates bidirectional inÔ¨Çuences between these constructs, with all indicators of centrality suggesting a key role of resilience in remission from depression. Limitations: The presented Ô¨Åndings are cross-sectional and networks are limited to a Ô¨Åxed set of key constructs in the literature pertaining cognitive vulnerability for depression.
Conclusions: These Ô¨Åndings indicate the importance of resilience to successfully cope with stressors following remission from depression. Further in-depth studies will be essential to identify the speciÔ¨Åc underlying resilience mechanisms that may be key to successful remission from depression.},

A range of methods and paradigms have been used to investigate various aspects of abnormal processing of facial expressions in major depression, including emotion specific deficits in recognition accuracy, response biases and attentional biases. The aim of this review is to examine and interpret data from studies of facial emotion processing in major depression, in the context of current knowledge about the neural correlates of facial expression processing of primary emotions. The review also discusses the methodologies used to examine facial expression processing. Studies of facial emotion processing and facial emotion recognition were identified up to December 2009 utilizing MEDLINE and Web of Science. Although methodological variations complicate interpretation of findings, there is reasonably consistent evidence of a negative response bias towards sadness in individuals with major depression, so that positive (happy), neutral or ambiguous facial expressions tend to be evaluated as more sad or less happy compared with healthy control groups. There is also evidence of increased vigilance and selective attention towards sad expressions and away from happy expressions, but less evidence of reduced general or emotion-specific recognition accuracy. Data is complicated by the use of multiple paradigms and the heterogeneity of major depression. Future studies should address methodological problems, including variations in patient characteristics, testing paradigms and procedures, and statistical methods used to analyse findings.},

When we relaxed two assumptions used in prior studies‚Äîthat (a) all classes have similar variability in levels of postadversity adjustment and (b) there is no variability in changes within classes‚Äîwe found that a resilience class was least common. Methodologically, our results show how findings on trajectories of change following major life stressors can vary substantially, depending on statistical model specifications. Conceptually, the results underscore the errors inherent in any categorical statements about ‚Äúrates of resilience‚Äù among individuals confronted with major life stressors. Pragmatically, they underscore the dangers in recommending against prophylactic interventions (on the basis of one method of analyzing longitudinal data) for individuals who have experienced major life stressors.},

	abstract = {A large number of studies have identified trajectories of adjustment following acute and aversive life events. In these studies, a stable trajectory of positive health or resilience is almost always the modal outcome (Bonanno, 2004; Bonanno et al., 2011). Infurna and Luthar (2016, this issue) reported that they replicated findings from two early studies in which trajectories of subjective well-being were identified before and after divorce, widowhood, and unemployment (Galatzer-Levy, Bonanno, \& Mancini, 2010; Mancini, Bonanno, \& Clark, 2011) and then reanalyzed these data in such a way to conclude a decrease in the prevalence of resilience. In this commentary, we discuss three serious flaws in Infurna and Luthar‚Äôs claims. First, they did not actually replicate our original analyses. They used different data, time points, and parameters. Second, the model specifications in their reanalyses were not optimal because they increased variance, reduced variability in response to the stressor, and had lower entropy, indicating that their models more poorly captured unique patterns of response. Third, their reanalyses were theoretically uninformative as they minimized both group differences and overall responses to the stressor event and thus failed to identify widely acknowledged populations, such as chronic stress reactivity.},

But, there are still many unresolved conceptual and research issues, as more variables are being proposed as relevant. As part of this process, the present paper proposes hardiness as an addition to positive psychology. Hardiness is a combination of attitudes that provides the courage and motivation to do the hard, strategic work of turning stressful circumstances from potential disasters into growth opportunities. In this regard, the inherently stressful nature of living is discussed. Also clarified are the particular aspects of excellence in performance and health to which hardiness is relevant. The paper concludes with a call for issue-resolving research through which orientations and actions proposed as part of positive psychology can be compared in their contributions to performance and health. Two studies along these lines have found hardiness more powerful than optimism and religiousness in coping with stresses.},

It is assumed that anxiety impairs efficient functioning of the goal-directed attentional system and increases the extent to which processing is influenced by the stimulus-driven attentional system. In addition to decreasing attentional control, anxiety increases attention to threat-related stimuli. Adverse effects of anxiety on processing efficiency depend on two central executive functions involving attentional control: inhibition and shifting. However, anxiety may not impair performance effectiveness (quality of performance) when it leads to the use of compensatory strategies (e.g., enhanced effort; increased use of processing resources). Directions for future research are discussed.},

High interview anxious volunteers were allocated to read descriptions of job interviews, either taking their own perspective in the described situation or that of a conÔ¨Ådent interviewee. At certain points during the text, a target letter string appeared and participants were asked to indicate whether it formed a word or a non-word (lexical decision). Some of the lexical decisions occurred in the context of ambiguous text that could be interpreted in both a threatening and a benign manner. In a baseline condition, decisions were made following text for which there was only one possible inference (either threat or benign). The results indicated that, compared to the self referent condition, participants who adopted the perspective of a conÔ¨Ådent other person showed enhanced inhibition of threat inferences.},

Few studies have compared the association of different types of biases and events with depression. The current study examined whether different cognitive biases and stressful childhood events variables were associated with depression and recurrence. Three types of childhood events were assessed in 83 neverdepressed and 337 formerly depressed individuals: trauma within the family, trauma outside the family, and adverse events. Furthermore, after a sad mood induction procedure, participants executed a Dot Probe task (selective attentional bias), an Emotional Stroop task (attentional interference bias) and an incidental learning task (memory bias). The association of these measures with case status and recurrence status (one or multiple past episodes) was examined. Negative memory bias and traumatic childhood events within the family were associated with case status, whereas none of the bias measures or childhood events variables were associated with recurrence status. The results indicate that memory bias as well as the experience of aggression and/or abuse within the family during childhood are independently associated with depression. Biases and stressful childhood events did not offer differentiation between individuals with one or multiple past episodes.},

Most particular in this regard are the positive biases in relation to self-esteem, control and optimism. Past controversies in relation to this proposition are reviewed and resolved in favour of the proposed mechanism.

The results indicated differences in the performance of one item (social well-being) for educational level, one item (social well-being) for sex, and two items (psychological well-being) for age. The MHC-SF is highly reliable over time, as there was no differential item functioning across the four timepoints. Furthermore, the means and reliabilities of the subscales were consistent over time.

	abstract = {Objectives. We investigated whether positive mental health predicts all-cause mortality.
Methods. Data were from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study (n = 3032), which at baseline in 1995 measured positive mental health (Ô¨Çourishing and not) and past-year mental illness (major depressive episode, panic attacks, and generalized anxiety disorders), and linked respondents with National Death Index records in a 10-year follow-up ending in 2005. Covariates were age, gender, race, education, any past-year mental illness, smoking, physical inactivity, physical diseases, and physical disease risk factors.
Results. A total of 6.3\% of participants died during the study period. The Ô¨Ånal and fully adjusted odds ratio of mortality was 1.62 (95\% conÔ¨Ådence interval [CI] = 1.00, 2.62; P = .05) for adults who were not Ô¨Çourishing, relative to participants with Ô¨Çourishing mental health. Age, gender, race, education, smoking, physical inactivity, cardiovascular disease, and HIV/AIDS were signiÔ¨Åcant predictors of death during the study period.
Conclusions. The absence of positive mental health increased the probability of all-cause mortality for men and women at all ages after adjustment for known causes of death. (Am J Public Health. 2012;102:2164‚Äì2172. doi:10.2105/AJPH. 2012.300918)},

	abstract = {Objectives. We sought to investigate the structure of the genetic and environmental inÔ¨Çuences on 3 measures of mental well-being.
Methods. Analyses focused on the subsample of 349 monozygotic and 321 dizygotic same-sex twin pairs from a nationally representative sample of twins who completed self-report measures of emotional, psychological, and social well-being.
Results. The best-Ô¨Åt model contained a common pathway to all 3 measures of well-being, no shared environmental effects, and 1 set of parameters for men and women. Heritability for the latent ‚Äò‚Äòmental well-being‚Äô‚Äô factor was high (72\%) and best indexed by psychological well-being. Moderate trait-speciÔ¨Åc genetic effects were seen for emotional and social well-being. Nonshared environmental effects for all measures were mostly trait speciÔ¨Åc.
Conclusions. Genetic inÔ¨Çuences on the measures of mental well-being reÔ¨Çect a single, highly heritable genetic factor, although some trait-speciÔ¨Åc genetic inÔ¨Çuences were seen for emotional and social well-being. Moderate proportions of environmental inÔ¨Çuences were also shared, but the majority of unique environment was trait-speciÔ¨Åc.

It remains unclear, however, whether socially anxious individuals are in fact more sensitive to disapproving emotions. We assessed decoding of, and cost attributions to, emotional expressions in high and low socially anxious females (n ¬º102) using Ô¨Åve emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, and sadness) expressed at 15 intensities (9‚Äì65\%), providing 75 stimuli (see Supplementary Material). The decoding task brieÔ¨Çy presented the stimuli and participants identiÔ¨Åed the emotion. The cost attribution task asked individuals to rate each stimulus for how costly it would be for them to interact with the person. Random effects regression indicated that social anxiety was not associated with overall decoding accuracy but was associated with a response bias. High socially anxious individuals had a lower threshold for decoding emotions but also more frequently classiÔ¨Åed low intensity emotions incorrectly. These effects were not emotion-speciÔ¨Åc. Socially anxious individuals also attributed excessive social cost to expressions of negative valence. Our results provide a novel conceptual framework for understanding emotion decoding in social anxiety, indicating the importance of considering both accuracy and response bias.},

Recent studies in animal models suggest that the degree to which one is able to control an aversive experience is a critical factor determining its behavioral consequences. In this study, we examined whether stressor controllability modulates subsequent conditioned fear expression in humans. Participants were randomly assigned to an escapable stressor condition, a yoked inescapable stressor condition, or a control condition involving no stress exposure. One week later, all participants underwent fear conditioning, fear extinction, and a test of extinction retrieval the following day. Participants exposed to inescapable stress showed impaired fear extinction learning and increased fear expression the following day. In contrast, escapable stress improved fear extinction and prevented the spontaneous recovery of fear. Consistent with the bidirectional controllability effects previously reported in animal models, these results suggest that one‚Äôs degree of control over aversive experiences may be an important factor inÔ¨Çuencing the development of psychological resilience or vulnerability in humans.},

	abstract = {Cognitive biases have been theorized to play a critical role in the onset and maintenance of anxiety and depression. Cognitive bias modification (CBM), an experimental paradigm that uses training to induce maladaptive or adaptive cognitive biases, was developed to test these causal models. Although CBM has generated considerable interest in the past decade, both as an experimental paradigm and as a form of treatment, there have been no quantitative reviews of the effect of CBM on anxiety and depression. This meta-analysis of 45 studies (2,591 participants) assessed the effect of CBM on cognitive biases and on anxiety and depression. CBM had a medium effect on biases (g œ≠ 0.49) that was stronger for interpretation (g œ≠ 0.81) than for attention (g œ≠ 0.29) biases. CBM further had a small effect on anxiety and depression (g œ≠ 0.13), although this effect was reliable only when symptoms were assessed after participants experienced a stressor (g œ≠ 0.23). When anxiety and depression were examined separately, CBM significantly modified anxiety but not depression. There was a nonsignificant trend toward a larger effect for studies including multiple training sessions. These findings are broadly consistent with cognitive theories of anxiety and depression that propose an interactive effect of cognitive biases and stressors on these symptoms. However, the small effect sizes observed here suggest that this effect may be more modest than previously believed.},

	abstract = {Background: Cognitive Bias ModiÔ¨Åcation (CBM) procedures have been used to train individuals to interpret ambiguous information in a negative or benign direction and have provided evidence that negative biases causally contribute to emotional vulnerability.
Method: Here we present the development and validation of a new form of CBM designed to manipulate the cognitive errors known to characterize both depression and anxiety. Our manipulation was designed to modify the biased cognitions identiÔ¨Åed by Beck‚Äôs cognitive error categories (e.g. arbitrary inference, overgeneralisation) and typically targeted during therapy.
Results: In a later test of spontaneous inferences, unselected (Experiment 1) and vulnerable participants (Experiment 2) who had generated positive alternatives rather than errors perceived novel hypothetical events, their causes and outcomes in a non-distorted manner. These groups were also less vulnerable to two different types of emotional stressor (video clips; and an imagined social situation). Furthermore participants‚Äô interpretation of their own performance on a problem-solving task was improved by the manipulation, despite actual performance showing no signiÔ¨Åcant change.
Conclusions: These Ô¨Åndings demonstrate that Cognitive Error ModiÔ¨Åcation can promote positive inferences, reduce vulnerability to stress and improve self-perceptions of performance. √ì 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {People with anxiety disorders often exhibit an attentional bias for threat. Attention bias modiÔ¨Åcation (ABM) procedure may reduce this bias, thereby diminishing anxiety symptoms. In ABM, participants respond to probes that reliably follow non-threatening stimuli (e.g., neutral faces) such that their attention is directed away from concurrently presented threatening stimuli (e.g., disgust faces). Early studies showed that ABM reduced anxiety more than control procedures lacking any contingency between valenced stimuli and probes. However, recent work suggests that no-contingency training and training toward threat cues can be as effective as ABM in reducing anxiety, implying that any training may increase executive control over attention, thereby helping people inhibit their anxious thoughts. Extending this work, we randomly assigned participants with DSM-IV diagnosed social anxiety disorder to either training toward non-threat (ABM), training toward threat, or no-contingency condition, and we used the attention network task (ANT) to assess all three components of attention. After two training sessions, subjects in all three conditions exhibited indistinguishably signiÔ¨Åcant declines from baseline to posttraining in self-report and behavioral measures of anxiety on an impromptu speech task. Moreover, all groups exhibited similarly signiÔ¨Åcant improvements on the alerting and executive (but not orienting) components of attention. Implications for ABM research are discussed.},

	abstract = {Despite the established evidence for threat-related attention bias in anxiety, the mechanisms underlying this bias remain unclear. One important unresolved question is whether disorder-congruent threats capture attention to a greater extent than do more general or disorder-incongruent threat stimuli. Evidence for attention bias speciÔ¨Åcity in anxiety would implicate involvement of previous learning and memory processes in threat-related attention bias, whereas lack of content speciÔ¨Åcity would point to perturbations in more generic attention processes. Enhanced clarity of mechanism could have clinical implications for the stimuli types used in Attention Bias ModiÔ¨Åcation Treatments (ABMT). Content speciÔ¨Åcity of threat-related attention bias in anxiety and potential moderators of this effect were investigated. A systematic search identiÔ¨Åed 37 samples from 29 articles (N = 866). Relevant data were extracted based on speciÔ¨Åc coding rules, and Cohen's d effect size was used to estimate bias speciÔ¨Åcity effects. The results indicate greater attention bias toward disorder-congruent relative to disorderincongruent threat stimuli (d = 0.28, p b 0.0001). This effect was not moderated by age, type of anxiety disorder, visual attention tasks, or type of disorder-incongruent stimuli. No evidence of publication bias was observed.

The current experiment investigated the converse possibility: that inducing an inferential bias can change the content of self-related images. The effects of repeated practice in accessing either negative or positive social outcomes was tested by having participants report on self-images generated during subsequent experience with ambiguous social situations. Participants and independent judges rated the content of participants‚Äô self-images as being more negative after prior practice in accessing negative rather than positive social outcomes. Furthermore, participants who practiced accessing negative outcomes rated their anticipated anxiety in an imagined stressful social situation as being greater, and their expected social performance as poorer than participants in the positive outcome group. Groups did not differ in state anxiety levels when making their ratings, so it is unlikely that any observed differences between groups can be attributed to mood effects. We suggest that this Ô¨Ånding is consistent with the hypothesis that inferential biases and content of self-images can interact with each other and may together serve to maintain social anxiety.},

Evidence that all of SWB‚Äôs genetic variance overlaps with personality led to the strong claim that it is a ‚Äòpersonality thing‚Äô and that personality is the strongest predictor of SWB. However, studies do not include a comprehensive assessment that reÔ¨Çects eudaimonic as well as hedonic SWB. We revisit the question of SWB‚Äôs complete overlap with personality employing the tripartite model‚Äîemotional, psychological, and social‚Äîof SWB that, together, reÔ¨Çect Keyes‚Äô (2002) model of Ô¨Çourishing. Data are from the Midlife in the United States national sample of 1,386 twins. Analyses were done using Mx to test Cholesky decomposition models and a two latent factor common pathway model. Onethird of the total (72 \%) heritability of Ô¨Çourishing and 40 \% of its environmental variability are distinct from the big-Ô¨Åve personality traits. We also Ô¨Ånd a low phenotypic association (mean r = .22) between the three dimensions of SWB and big-Ô¨Åve personality traits despite substantial shared genetic etiology. In addition to non-trivial amounts of distinctive genetic and environmental variance and low phenotypic correlation, we point to limited investigation of reciprocal causation of SWB and personality. Psychologist should not yet conclude that SWB is a ‚Äòpersonality thing‚Äô anymore than personality might be a ‚Äòwellbeing thing‚Äô.},

Positive Feelings, Negative Feelings, and the balance between the two (SPANE-P, N, B); and 3. Positive Thinking. The PWB scale is a short 8-item summary survey of the person‚Äôs self-perceived functioning in important areas such as relationships, self-esteem, purpose and meaning, and optimism. The scale is substantially correlated with other psychological well-being scales, but is briefer. The scale provides a single overall psychological well-being score and does not yield scores for various components of well-being. The Scale of Positive and Negative Experience (SPANE) yields a score for positive experience and feelings (6 items), a score for negative experience and feelings (6 items), and the two can be combined to create an experience balance score. This 12-item brief scale has a number of desirable features compared to earlier measures of positive and negative feelings. In particular, the scale assesses with a few items a broad range of negative and positive experiences and feelings, not just those of a certain type, and is based on the frequency of feelings during the past month. A scale to measure Positive Thinking is also presented. Basic psychometric statistics are presented for the scales based on 573 college students at Ô¨Åve universities.},

	abstract = {Governments around the world are recognising the importance of measuring subjective well-being as an indicator of progress. But how should well-being be measured? A conceptual framework is offered which equates high well-being with positive mental health. Well-being is seen as lying at the opposite end of a spectrum to the common mental disorders (depression, anxiety). By examining internationally agreed criteria for depression and anxiety (DSM and ICD classiÔ¨Åcations), and deÔ¨Åning the opposite of each symptom, we identify ten features of positive well-being. These combine feeling and functioning, i.e. hedonic and eudaimonic aspects of well-being: competence, emotional stability, engagement, meaning, optimism, positive emotion, positive relationships, resilience, self esteem, and vitality. An operational deÔ¨Ånition of Ô¨Çourishing is developed, based on psychometric analysis of indicators of these ten features, using data from a representative sample of 43,000 Europeans. Application of this deÔ¨Ånition to respondents from the 23 countries which participated in the European Social Survey (Round 3) reveals a four-fold difference in Ô¨Çourishing rate, from 41\% in Denmark to less than 10\% in Slovakia, Russia and Portugal. There are also striking differences in country proÔ¨Åles across the 10 features. These proÔ¨Åles offer fresh insight into cultural differences in well-being, and indicate which features may provide the most promising targets for policies to improve well-being. Comparison with a life satisfaction measure shows that valuable information would be lost if well-being was measured by life satisfaction.

	abstract = {People with anxiety disorders often exhibit an attentional bias for threat. Attention bias modiÔ¨Åcation (ABM) procedure may reduce this bias, thereby diminishing anxiety symptoms. In ABM, participants respond to probes that reliably follow non-threatening stimuli (e.g., neutral faces) such that their attention is directed away from concurrently presented threatening stimuli (e.g., disgust faces). Early studies showed that ABM reduced anxiety more than control procedures lacking any contingency between valenced stimuli and probes. However, recent work suggests that no-contingency training and training toward threat cues can be as effective as ABM in reducing anxiety, implying that any training may increase executive control over attention, thereby helping people inhibit their anxious thoughts. Extending this work, we randomly assigned participants with DSM-IV diagnosed social anxiety disorder to either training toward non-threat (ABM), training toward threat, or no-contingency condition, and we used the attention network task (ANT) to assess all three components of attention. After two training sessions, subjects in all three conditions exhibited indistinguishably signiÔ¨Åcant declines from baseline to posttraining in self-report and behavioral measures of anxiety on an impromptu speech task. Moreover, all groups exhibited similarly signiÔ¨Åcant improvements on the alerting and executive (but not orienting) components of attention. Implications for ABM research are discussed.},

After noting the crucial importance of first testing for the environmental mediation of risk through ‚Äúnatural experiments,‚Äù findings are reviewed on ‚Äústeeling effects‚Äù in animal models and humans. Gene‚Äìenvironment interaction findings are considered, and it is noted that there is some evidence that the genetic influences concerns responsivity to all environments and not just bad ones. Life course effects are reviewed in relation to evidence on turning point effects associated with experiences that increase opportunities and enhance coping.

As empirical research on resilience has burgeoned in recent years, criticisms have been levied at work in this area. These critiques have generally focused on ambiguities in definitions and central terminology; heterogeneity in risks experienced and competence achieved by individuals viewed as resilient; instability of the phenomenon of resilience; and concerns regarding the usefulness of resilience as a theoretical construct. We address each identified criticism in turn, proposing solutions for those we view as legitimate and clarifying misunderstandings surrounding those we believe to be less valid. We conclude that work on resilience possesses substantial potential for augmenting the understanding of processes affecting at-risk individuals. Realization of the potential embodied by this construct, however, will remain constrained without continued scientific attention to some of the serious conceptual and methodological pitfalls that have been noted by skeptics and proponents alike.},

Participants high in trait resilience (HighR) exhibited more complete aÔ¨Äective recovery (compared to LowR) after viewing a neutral picture that could have been aversive.

	abstract = {The complexities of deÔ¨Åning what appears to be the relatively simple concept of resilience are widely recognized. This paper analyses the concept of resilience from a range of disciplinary perspectives and clariÔ¨Åes a deÔ¨Ånition in order to inform research, policy and practice. The work takes a life course approach to resilience, examining evidence derived from research across the lifespan. It incorporates the methods of systematic review, concept analysis and consultation through face-to-face meetings. The synthesis of methodological approaches enables a clear identiÔ¨Åcation of the antecedents, deÔ¨Åning attributes and consequences of resilience, validated with stakeholder partners. Through this process, resilience is deÔ¨Åned as the process of effectively negotiating, adapting to, or managing signiÔ¨Åcant sources of stress or trauma. Assets and resources within the individual, their life and environment facilitate this capacity for adaptation and ‚Äòbouncing back‚Äô in the face of adversity. Across the life course, the experience of resilience will vary. A large proportion of resilience research is routed within the discipline of developmental psychology, and has mainly been developed with children and adolescents. A major contribution to resilience research could be made through more multi-disciplinary studies that examine the dynamics of resilience across the lifespan, its role in healthy ageing and in managing loss, such as changes in cognitive functioning.},

	abstract = {Objective: To review the literature on psychological and biological Ô¨Åndings on resilience (i.e. the successful adaptation and swift recovery after experiencing life adversities) at the level of the individual, and to integrate Ô¨Åndings from animal and human studies.
Method: Electronic and manual literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and PSYCHINFO, using a range of search terms around biological and psychological factors inÔ¨Çuencing resilience as observed in human and experimental animal studies, complemented by review articles and cross-references.
Results: The term resilience is used in the literature for diÔ¨Äerent phenomena ranging from prevention of mental health disturbance to successful adaptation and swift recovery after experiencing life adversities, and may also include post-traumatic psychological growth. Secure attachment, experiencing positive emotions and having a purpose in life are three important psychological building blocks of resilience. Overlap between psychological and biological Ô¨Åndings on resilience in the literature is most apparent for the topic of stress sensitivity, although recent results suggest a crucial role for reward experience in resilience.
Conclusion: Improving the understanding of the links between genetic endowment, environmental impact and gene‚Äìenvironment interactions with developmental psychology and biology is crucial for elucidating the neurobiological and psychological underpinnings of resilience.},

Questionnaire data on the adolescents‚Äô Ego-resilience (ER89) was collected from mothers, fathers and twins, and analysed by means of multivariate genetic modelling. Variance in trait resilience was best represented in an ADE common pathways model with sex limitation. Variance in the latent psychometric resilience factor was largely explained by additive genetic factors (77\% in boys, 70\% in girls), with the remaining variance (23 and 30\%) attributable to non-shared environmental factors. Additive genetic sources explained more than 50\% of the informant speciÔ¨Åc variation in mothers and fathers scores. In twins, additive and non-additive genetic factors together explained 40\% and non-shared environmental factor the remaining 60\% of variation. In the mothers‚Äô scores, the additive genetic effect was larger for boys than for girls. The non-additive genetic factor found in the twins‚Äô self ratings was larger in boys than in girls. The remaining sex differences in the speciÔ¨Åc factors were small. Trait resilience is largely genetically determined.},

	abstract = {Background: While resilience has been deÔ¨Åned as resistance to illness, adaptation, and thriving, the ability to bounce back or recover from stress is closest to its original meaning. Previous resilience measures assess resources that may promote resilience rather than recovery, resistance, adaptation, or thriving. Purpose: To test a new brief resilience scale. Method: The brief resilience scale (BRS) was created to assess the ability to bounce back or recover from stress. Its psychometric characteristics were examined in four samples, including two student samples and samples with cardiac and chronic pain patients. Results: The BRS was reliable and measured as a unitary construct. It was predictably related to personal characteristics, social relations, coping, and health in all samples. It was negatively related to anxiety, depression, negative affect, and physical symptoms when other resilience measures and optimism, social support, and Type D personality (high negative affect and high social inhibition) were controlled. There were large differences in BRS scores between cardiac patients with and without Type D and women with and without Ô¨Åbromyalgia. Conclusion: The BRS is a reliable means of assessing resilience as the ability to bounce back or recover from stress and may provide unique and important information about people coping with health-related stressors.},

Despite its fairly widespread use, little is known about the psychometric properties of the scale in adult samples. In the present study, factor structure of the ACS and its relationship with symptoms of anxiety and depression was investigated in a total sample of 728 Icelandic university students. Exploratory factor analysis in sample 1 (n = 361), yielded two factors, labeled focusing and shifting. ConÔ¨Årmatory factor analysis in sample 2 (n = 367) showed a reasonable Ô¨Åt of this two factor model. The two factors correlated strongly (0.73). The two subscales showed different predictive validity in a set of hierarchical regression analyses where the focusing subscale made a significant prediction of anxiety scores when depression scores were controlled for, and the shifting subscale signiÔ¨Åcant prediction of depression scores when anxiety scores were controlled for. These Ô¨Åndings are discussed in relation to previous studies on attentional and executive control in anxiety and depression. ¬© 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In comparison to the BDI and BAI, the DASS scales showed greater separation in factor loadings. The DASS Anxiety scale correlated 0.81 with the BAI, and the DASS Depression scale correlated 0.74 with the BDI. Factor analyses suggested that the BDI differs from the DASS Depression scale primarily in that the BDI includes items such as weight loss, insomnia, somatic preoccupation and irritability, which fail to discriminate between depression and other affective states. The factor structure of the combined BDI and BAI items was virtually identical to that reported by Beck for a sample of diagnosed depressed and anxious patients, supporting the view that these clinical states are more severe expressions of the same states that may be discerned in normals. Implications of the results for the conceptualisation of depression, anxiety and tension/stress are considered, and the utility of the DASS scales in discriminating between these constructs is discussed.},

To test the construct validity of the short-form version of the Depression anxiety and stress scale (DASS-21), and in particular, to assess whether stress as indexed by this measure is synonymous with negative affectivity (NA) or whether it represents a related, but distinct, construct. To provide normative data for the general adult population. Design. Cross-sectional, correlational and conÔ¨Årmatory factor analysis (CFA).
Methods. The DASS-21 was administered to a non-clinical sample, broadly representative of the general adult UK population (N ¬º 1; 794). Competing models of the latent structure of the DASS-21 were evaluated using CFA.
Results. The model with optimal Ô¨Åt (RCFI ¬º 0.94) had a quadripartite structure, and consisted of a general factor of psychological distress plus orthogonal speciÔ¨Åc factors of depression, anxiety, and stress. This model was a signiÔ¨Åcantly better Ô¨Åt than a competing model that tested the possibility that the Stress scale simply measures NA.
Conclusions. The DASS-21 subscales can validly be used to measure the dimensions of depression, anxiety, and stress. However, each of these subscales also taps a more general dimension of psychological distress or NA. The utility of the measure is enhanced by the provision of normative data based on a large sample.},

Methods. The DASS was administered to a non-clinical sample, broadly representative of the general adult UK population (N = 1,771) in terms of demographic variables. Competing models of the latent structure of the DASS were derived from theoretical and empirical sources and evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis. Correlational analysis was used to determine the influence of demographic variables on DASS scores. The convergent and discriminant validity of the measure was examined through correlating the measure with two other measures of depression and anxiety (the HADS and the sAD), and a measure of positive and negative affectivity (the PANAS).
Results. The best fitting model (CFI = .93) of the latent structure of the DASS consisted of three correlated factors corresponding to the depression, anxiety and stress scales with correlated error permitted between items comprising the DASS subscales. Demographic variables had only very modest influences on DASS scores. The reliability of the DASS was excellent, and the measure possessed adequate convergent and discriminant validity
Conclusions. The DASS is a reliable and valid measure of the constructs it was intended to assess. The utility of this measure for UK clinicians is enhanced by the provision of large sample normative data.},

	abstract = {Cognitive theories of depression posit that people‚Äôs thoughts, inferences, attitudes, and interpretations, and the way in which they attend to and recall information, can increase their risk for depression. Three mechanisms have been implicated in the relation between biased cognitive processing and the dysregulation of emotion in depression: inhibitory processes and deÔ¨Åcits in working memory, ruminative responses to negative mood states and negative life events, and the inability to use positive and rewarding stimuli to regulate negative mood. In this review, we present a contemporary characterization of depressive cognition and discuss how different cognitive processes are related not only to each other, but also to emotion dysregulation, the hallmark feature of depression. We conclude that depression is characterized by increased elaboration of negative information, by difÔ¨Åculties disengaging from negative material, and by deÔ¨Åcits in cognitive control when processing negative information. We discuss treatment implications of these conclusions and argue that the study of cognitive aspects of depression must be broadened by investigating neural and genetic factors that are related to cognitive dysfunction in this disorder. Such integrative investigations should help us gain a more comprehensive understanding of how cognitive and biological factors interact to affect the onset, maintenance, and course of depression.},

Conclusions: These results suggest that a single dose of an antidepressant can increase the processing of positively valenced material in nondepressed volunteers.

Overt visual attention to the emotional and neutral faces was measured in 50 ms segments across the trial. Over time, participants with social phobia attend less to emotional faces and speciÔ¨Åcally less to happy faces compared to controls. Further, attention to emotional relative to neutral expressions did not vary notably by emotion for participants with social phobia, but control participants showed a pattern after 1000 ms in which over time they preferentially attended to happy expressions and avoided negative expressions. Findings highlight the importance of considering attention biases to positive stimuli as well as the pattern of attention between groups. These results suggest that attention ‚Äúbias‚Äù in social phobia may be driven by a relative lack of the biases seen in non-anxious participants.},

Several models have been advanced to explain these biases in anxiety, yet the mechanisms comprising and mediating the biases remain unclear. In the present article, we review evidence regarding the mechanisms of attentional biases through careful examination of the components of attentional bias, the mechanisms underlying these components, and the stage of information processing during which the biases occur. Facilitated attention, difÔ¨Åculty in disengagement, and attentional avoidance comprise the components of attentional bias. A threat detection mechanism likely underlies facilitated attention, a process that may be neurally centered around the amygdala. Attentional control ability likely underlies difÔ¨Åculty in disengagement, emotion regulation goals likely underlie attentional avoidance, and both of these processes may be neurally centered around prefrontal cortex functioning. The threat detection mechanism may be a mostly automatic process, attentional avoidance may be a mostly strategic process, and difÔ¨Åculty in disengagement may be a mixture of automatic and strategic processing. Recommendations for future research are discussed.},

In the current paper, we report a direct test of this hypothesis in individuals with social phobia. Participants performed a variation of the Posner paradigm (Quart. J. Exp. Psycho. 32 (1980) 3). Social threat, neutral, or positive words cued one of two locations on the computer screen. After the cue disappeared, participants had to detect a probe (‚Äú‚àó‚Äù) that appeared in one of the two locations. On some trials the cue was valid (i.e., the probe appeared in the same location as the cue). On other trials the cue was invalid (the probe appeared in a different location than the cue). Yet, on other trials, no cue was presented. All participants were slower in detecting probes following invalid cues than probes following valid cues. Furthermore, individuals with social phobia showed signiÔ¨Åcantly longer response latencies when detecting invalidly cued targets than did controls, but only when the probe followed a social threat word. These results suggest that individuals with social phobia may have difÔ¨Åculty disengaging their attention from socially threatening material.},

According to attentional control theory, anxiety impairs the efÔ¨Åciency of two executive functions (the inhibition and shifting functions). Another major theoretical assumption is that anxiety impairs performance effectiveness (the quality of performance) to a lesser extent than processing efÔ¨Åciency (the relationship between performance effectiveness and effort or use of processing resources). However, there may be conditions (e.g., prior presentation of threat-related stimuli) in which that assumption is not applicable. The extensive recent research (including several cognitive neuroscience studies) of direct relevance to the theory is discussed, and suggestions are made for maximizing the value of future cognitive neuroscience research. Finally, attentional control theory is developed to explicate the relationship between anxiety and motivation. Implications for theoretical predictions and alternative theoretical accounts are discussed.},

	abstract = {Background: In the current study, we investigated whether the internal reliability of the visual probe task measure of attentional bias for substance-related cues could be improved by incorporating eye-tracking methods and personalised stimuli. Method: Sixty social drinkers completed two visual probe tasks: one with a broad range of different alcohol pictures, the other containing only images of the participants‚Äô preferred drink. Attentional bias was inferred from manual reaction times to probes replacing the pictures, and from the duration of eye movement Ô¨Åxations towards the pictures (gaze dwell time). Results: Internal reliability was highest for personalised (versus general) alcohol stimuli, and for eyetracking (versus manual reaction time) measures of attentional bias. The internal reliability of both reaction time (Àõ = .73) and gaze dwell time measures (Àõ = .76) of attentional bias for personalised alcohol stimuli was acceptable. Internal reliability of indices of attentional bias for general alcohol stimuli was inferior, although better for the gaze dwell time (Àõ = .51) compared to the reaction time measure (Àõ = .19). Attentional bias towards personalised stimuli was larger than bias to general stimuli, but only for the reaction time measure. There were no statistically signiÔ¨Åcant associations between measures of attentional bias and alcohol consumption or craving. Conclusions: Adopting personalised stimuli and eye movement monitoring signiÔ¨Åcantly improves the internal reliability of the alcohol-related visual probe task. ¬© 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Recently, cognitive bias modiÔ¨Åcation (CBM) procedures have shown that such negative biases are causally related to emotional vulnerability. However, research using CBM has been notably lacking in depression. This is the Ô¨Årst double blind randomised controlled study investigating the effect of cognitive bias modiÔ¨Åcation-errors (CBM-errors), on depression and its inÔ¨Çuence on mood and resilience to stress. CBM-errors is a new form of cognitive bias modiÔ¨Åcation for interpretation, which targets the full range of cognitive errors, as well as interpretation biases. Forty clinically depressed participants were randomly allocated to a positive training group or neutral text reading control group. Participants trained to make positive interpretations subsequently interpreted novel ambiguous information in a positive manner compared to controls. The results suggest that a positive cognitive bias can be induced in clinically depressed individuals using a simple computerised intervention. There was little evidence of corresponding beneÔ¨Åts in terms of mood or response to stress, suggesting that multiple sessions are likely to be needed to confer symptom related change. A systematic investigation of the optimum number and timing of multiple sessions is now called for.},

At both pre and post training, participants completed measures of depressive symptoms, rumination and inhibition bias. Compared with individuals in the sham training condition, those who were trained to attend to negative stimuli exhibited a signiÔ¨Åcant decrease in inhibition of irrelevant negative content whereas those who were trained to inhibit negative stimuli, showed a trend toward improved inhibition of irrelevant negative content and a reduction in brooding, but not in depressive symptoms.

In part I of this series we outline ten prominent advantages of the Bayesian approach. Many of these advantages translate to concrete opportunities for pragmatic researchers. For instance, Bayesian hypothesis testing allows researchers to quantify evidence and monitor its progression as data come in, without needing to know the intention with which the data were collected. We end by countering several objections to Bayesian hypothesis testing. Part II of this series discusses JASP, a free and open source software program that makes it easy to conduct Bayesian estimation and testing for a range of popular statistical scenarios (Wagenmakers et al., this issue).},

	abstract = {The dominant paradigm for inference in psychology is a null-hypothesis significance testing one. Recently, the foundations of this paradigm have been shaken by several notable replication failures. One recommendation to remedy the replication crisis is to collect larger samples of participants. We argue that this recommendation misses a critical point, which is that increasing sample size will not remedy psychology‚Äôs lack of strong measurement, lack of strong theories and models, and lack of effective experimental control over error variance. In contrast, there is a long history of research in psychology employing small-N designs that treats the individual participant as the replication unit, which addresses each of these failings, and which produces results that are robust and readily replicated. We illustrate the properties of small-N and largeN designs using a simulated paradigm investigating the stage structure of response times. Our simulations highlight the high power and inferential validity of the small-N design, in contrast to the lower power and inferential indeterminacy of the large-N design. We argue that, if psychology is to be a mature quantitative science, then its primary theoretical aim should be to investigate systematic, functional relationships as they are manifested at the individual participant level and that, wherever possible, it should use methods that are optimized to identify relationships of this kind.},

A speciÔ¨Åc form of this novel treatment approach is approach‚Äìavoidance modiÔ¨Åcation. In order to examine the efÔ¨Åcacy of approach‚Äìavoidance modiÔ¨Åcation for positive stimuli associated with social anxiety, we recruited 43 individuals with social anxiety disorder and randomly assigned them to a training (implicit training to approach smiling faces) or a control (equal approach and avoidance of smiling faces) condition in three sessions over the course of a 1-week period. Dependent measures included clinician ratings, self-report measures of social anxiety, and overt behavior during behavioral approach tasks. No group differences in any of the outcome measures were observed after training. In addition, while individuals in the training group showed increased approach tendency in one of the sessions, this effect was inconsistent across the three sessions and did not result in long-term changes in implicit approach tendencies between the groups over the course of the entire study. These results suggest that approach‚Äìavoidance modiÔ¨Åcation might result in short-lasting effects on implicit approach tendencies towards feared positive stimuli, but this modiÔ¨Åcation may not result in meaningful behavioral change or symptom reduction in individuals with social anxiety disorder.},

	abstract = {Background: Optimal psychological development is dependent upon a complex interplay between individual and situational factors. Investigating the development of these factors in adolescence will help to improve understanding of emotional vulnerability and resilience. The CogBIAS longitudinal study (CogBIAS-L-S) aims to combine cognitive and genetic approaches to investigate risk and protective factors associated with the development of mood and impulsivity-related outcomes in an adolescent sample. Methods: CogBIAS-L-S is a three-wave longitudinal study of typically developing adolescents conducted over 4 years, with data collection at age 12, 14 and 16. At each wave participants will undergo multiple assessments including a range of selective cognitive processing tasks (e.g. attention bias, interpretation bias, memory bias) and psychological self-report measures (e.g. anxiety, depression, resilience). Saliva samples will also be collected at the baseline assessment for genetic analyses. Multilevel statistical analyses will be performed to investigate the developmental trajectory of cognitive biases on psychological functioning, as well as the influence of genetic moderation on these relationships. Discussion: CogBIAS-L-S represents the first longitudinal study to assess multiple cognitive biases across adolescent development and the largest study of its kind to collect genetic data. It therefore provides a unique opportunity to understand how genes and the environment influence the development and maintenance of cognitive biases and provide insight into risk and protective factors that may be key targets for intervention.},

	abstract = {Recent efforts have been made to understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying psychological resilience. Cognitive flexibility in the context of affective information has been related to individual differences in resilience. However, it is unclear whether flexible affective processing is sensitive to mood fluctuations. Furthermore, it remains to be investigated how effects on flexible affective processing interact with the affective valence of information that is presented. To fill this gap, we tested the effects of positive mood and individual differences in self-reported resilience on affective flexibility, using a task switching paradigm (N œ≠ 80). The main findings showed that positive mood was related to lower task switching costs, reflecting increased flexibility, in line with previous findings. In line with this effect of positive mood, we showed that greater resilience levels, specifically levels of acceptance of self and life, also facilitated task set switching in the context of affective information. However, the effects of resilience on affective flexibility seem more complex. Resilience tended to relate to more efficient task switching when negative information was preceded by positive information, possibly because the presentation of positive information, as well as positive mood, can facilitate task set switching. Positive mood also influenced costs associated with switching affective valence of the presented information. This latter effect was indicative of a reduced impact of no longer relevant negative information and more impact of no longer relevant positive information. Future research should confirm these effects of individual differences in resilience on affective flexibility, considering the affective valence of the presented information.},

But the extent to which in-principle benefits of data sharing are realized in practice is unclear. Crucially, it is largely unknown whether published findings can be reproduced by repeating reported analyses upon shared data (‚Äúanalytic reproducibility‚Äù). To investigate, we conducted an observational evaluation of a mandatory open data policy introduced at the journal Cognition. Interrupted time-series analyses indicated a substantial post-policy increase in data available statements (104/417, 25\% pre-policy to 136/174, 78\% post-policy), although not all data appeared reusable (23/104, 22\% pre-policy to 85/136, 62\%, post-policy). For 35 of the articles determined to have reusable data, we attempted to reproduce 1324 target values. Ultimately, 64 values could not be reproduced within a 10\% margin of error. For 22 articles all target values were reproduced, but 11 of these required author assistance. For 13 articles at least one value could not be reproduced despite author assistance. Importantly there were no clear indications that original conclusions were seriously impacted. Mandatory open data policies can increase the frequency and quality of data sharing. However, suboptimal data curation, unclear analysis specification, and reporting errors can impede analytic reproducibility, undermining the utility of data sharing and the credibility of scientific findings.},

	abstract = {To cast valid predictions of future behavior or diagnose disorders, the reliable measurement of a ‚Äúbiomarker‚Äù such as the brain activation to prospective reward is a prerequisite. Surprisingly, only a small fraction of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies report or cite the reliability of brain activation maps involved in group analyses. Here, using simulations and exemplary longitudinal data of 126 healthy adolescents performing an intertemporal choice task, we demonstrate that reproducing a group activation map over time is not a sufficient indication of reliable measurements at the individual level. Instead, selecting regions based on significant main effects at the group level may yield estimates that fail to reliably capture individual variance in the subjective evaluation of an offer. Collectively, our results call for more attention on the reliability of supposed biomarkers at the level of the individual. Thus, caution is warranted in employing brain activation patterns prematurely for clinical applications such as diagnosis or tailored interventions before their reliability has been conclusively established by large-scale studies. To facilitate assessing and reporting of the reliability of fMRI contrasts in future studies, we provide a toolbox that incorporates common measures of global and local reliability.},

The purpose of this investigation was to (a) determine the frequency with which published articles appearing in health education and behavior journals report the psychometric properties of the scales/subscales employed and (b) outline the methods used to determine the reliability and validity of the scores produced. The results reported herein are based on a final sample of 967 published articles, spanning seven prominent health education and behavior journals between 2007 and 2010. Of the 967 articles examined, an exceedingly high percentage failed to report any validity (ranging from 40\% to 93\%) or reliability (ranging from 35\% to 80\%) statistics in their articles. For health education/behavior practitioners and researchers to maximize the utility and applicability of their findings, they must evaluate the psychometric properties of the instrument employed, a practice that is currently underrepresented in the literature. By not ensuring the instruments employed in a given study were able to produce accurate and consistent scores, researchers cannot be certain they actually measured the behaviors and/or constructs reported.},

	abstract = {The recent field-wide emphasis on power has brought the number of participants used in psychological experiments into focus. Social psychology typically follows a tradition in which many participants perform a small number of trials each; in psychophysics, the tradition is to include only a few participants, who perform many trials each; and the tradition in cognitive psychology falls in between, balancing the number of participants and trials. We ask whether it is better to add trials or to add participants if one wishes to increase power. The answer is straightforward‚Äîgreatest power is achieved by using more people, and the gain from adding people is greater than the gain from adding trials. In light of these results, the design parameters in the social psychology tradition seem ideal. Yet there are conditions in which one may trade people for trials with only a minor decrement in power. Under these conditions, the limiting factor is the trial-to-trial variability rather than the variability across people in the population. These conditions are highly plausible, and we present a theoretical argument as to why. We think that most cognitive effects are characterized by stochastic dominance; that is, everyone‚Äôs true effect is in the same direction. For example, it is plausible that when performing the Stroop task, all people truly identify congruent colors faster than incongruent ones. When dominance holds, small mean effects imply a small degree of variability across the population. It is this degree of homogeneity, the consequence of dominance, that licenses the design parameters of the cognitive psychology and psychophysics traditions.},

	abstract = {Background: The network approach to mental disorders offers a novel framework for conceptualizing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a causal system of interacting symptoms. Objective: In this study, we extended this work by estimating the structure of relations among PTSD symptoms in adults reporting personal histories of childhood sexual abuse (CSA; N = 179). Method: We employed two complementary methods. First, using the graphical LASSO, we computed a sparse, regularized partial correlation network revealing associations (edges) between pairs of PTSD symptoms (nodes). Next, using a Bayesian approach, we computed a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to estimate a directed, potentially causal model of the relations among symptoms. Results: For the first network, we found that physiological reactivity to reminders of trauma, dreams about the trauma, and lost of interest in previously enjoyed activities were highly central nodes. However, stability analyses suggest that these findings were unstable across subsets of our sample. The DAG suggests that becoming physiologically reactive and upset in response to reminders of the trauma may be key drivers of other symptoms in adult survivors of CSA. Conclusions: Our study illustrates the strengths and limitations of these network analytic approaches to PTSD.},

Provided formulas include: (a) Cronbach‚Äôs alpha and omega coefficients for unidimensional measures with quantitative item response scales, (b) coefficients ordinal omega, ordinal alpha and nonlinear reliability for unidimensional measures with dichotomic and ordinal items, (c) coefficients omega and omega hierarchical for essentially unidimensional scales presenting method effects. The procedure is generalized to weighted sum measures, multidimensional scales, complex designs with multilevel and/or missing data and to scale development.

	abstract = {Background: Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide and, although efficacious treatments are available, their efficacy is suboptimal and recurrence of symptoms is common. Effective preventive strategies could reduce disability and the long term social and health complications associated with the disorder, but current options are limited. Cognitive bias modification (CBM) is a novel, simple, and safe intervention that addresses attentional and interpretive biases associated with anxiety, dysphoria, and depression. The primary aim of this trial is to determine if CBM decreases the one-year onset of a major depressive episode among adults with subsyndromal depression. Design and methods: This randomised controlled trial will recruit 532 adults with subsyndromal symptoms of depression living in the Australian community (parallel design, 1:1 allocation ratio). Participants will be free of clinically significant symptoms of depression and of psychotic disorders, sensory and cognitive impairment, and risky alcohol use. The CBM intervention will target attentional and interpretive biases associated with depressive symptoms. The sessions will be delivered via the internet over a period of 52 weeks. The primary outcome of interest is the onset of a major depressive episode according the DSM-IV-TR criteria over a 12-month period. Secondary outcomes of interest include change in the severity of depressive symptoms as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), use of antidepressants or benzodiazepines, and changes in attention and interpretive biases. The assessment of outcomes will take place 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after randomisation and will occur via the internet. Discussion: We propose to test the efficacy of an innovative intervention that is well grounded in theory and for which increasing empirical evidence for an effect on mood is available. The intervention is simple, inexpensive, easy to access, and could be easily rolled out into practice if our findings confirm a role for CBM in the prevention of depression.

In the current paper, we report a direct test of this hypothesis in individuals with social phobia. Participants performed a variation of the Posner paradigm (Quart. J. Exp. Psycho. 32 (1980) 3). Social threat, neutral, or positive words cued one of two locations on the computer screen. After the cue disappeared, participants had to detect a probe (‚Äú‚àó‚Äù) that appeared in one of the two locations. On some trials the cue was valid (i.e., the probe appeared in the same location as the cue). On other trials the cue was invalid (the probe appeared in a different location than the cue). Yet, on other trials, no cue was presented. All participants were slower in detecting probes following invalid cues than probes following valid cues. Furthermore, individuals with social phobia showed signiÔ¨Åcantly longer response latencies when detecting invalidly cued targets than did controls, but only when the probe followed a social threat word. These results suggest that individuals with social phobia may have difÔ¨Åculty disengaging their attention from socially threatening material.},

	abstract = {Objective: The Attention Network Test (ANT) is a tool used to assess the efÔ¨Åciency of the 3 attention networks‚Äîalerting, orienting, and executive control. The ANT has become popular in the neuropsychological literature since its Ô¨Årst description in 2002, with some form of the task currently appearing in no less than 65 original research papers. Although several general reviews of the ANT exist, none provide an analysis of its psychometric properties. Method: Data from 15 unique studies were collected, resulting in a large sample (N œ≠ 1,129) of healthy individuals. Split-half reliability, variance structure, distribution shape, and independence of measurement of the 3 attention network scores were analyzed, considering both reaction time and accuracy as dependent variables. Results: Split-half reliabilities of reaction time based attention network scores were low for alerting (rweighted œ≠ .20, CI 95\%weighted [.14, .27], Spearman‚ÄìBrown r œ≠ .38) and orienting (rweighted œ≠ .32, CI 95\%weighted [.26, .38], Spearman‚ÄìBrown r œ≠ .55), and moderate high for executive control (rweighted œ≠ .65, CI 95\%weighted [.61, .71], Spearman‚ÄìBrown r œ≠ .81). Analysis of the variance structure of the ANT indicated that power to Ô¨Ånd signiÔ¨Åcant effects was variable across networks and dependent on the statistical analysis being used. Both analysis of variance (signiÔ¨Åcant interaction observed in 100\% of 15 studies) and correlational analyses (multiplesigniÔ¨Åcant inter-network correlations observed) suggest that the networks measured by the ANT are not independent. Conclusions: In the collection, analysis and interpretation of any test data, psychometric properties, such as those reported here for the ANT, must be carefully considered.},

Several authors have argued that CBM-A in fact trains top-down, reactive counteraction of the tendency to orient towards threat. Imposing a working memory (WM) load during training should therefore limit its efÔ¨Åcacy, since WM resources are required for goal-driven control of attention. Twenty-eight subclinical high-anxious participants completed two sessions of CBM-A or placebo training: one under a high WM load, and one under a low WM load. Attentional bias was assessed after each training. CBM-A produced an attentional bias away from threat under low load, but not under high load. These results suggest CBM-A trains top-down counteraction of orienting to threat. It also suggests the administration of CBM-A in the home environment may be affected by everyday worries and distractions.},

Various measures have been developed to index these biases; unfortunately, the psychometric properties of response time measures of attentional bias have not been thoroughly evaluated, and the reliability of those that have been evaluated is poor. The current study assessed the reliability and convergent validity of dot probe and emotional cueing bias scores in high-anxious and low-anxious participants in the context of a state anxiety manipulation to increase the likelihood of producing large, potentially reliable attentional biases. One hundred sixty participants completed an anxious or calm mood induction followed by dot probe and emotional cueing tasks. Reliability estimates for bias scores in the full sample were low, ranging from 0 to .44; convergent validity estimates were also poor. The anxiety induction did not substantially improve the reliability or validity of the measures. These results underscore the importance of developing new, more reliable attentional bias measures for future research.},

We know relatively little, however, about the speciÔ¨Åc factors that contribute to this elevated risk. The present study investigated the effects of familial risk for depression and the 5-HTTLPR and COMT Val158Met polymorphisms, which have been associated with risk for depression, on biases in endorsement of and memory for positive and negative adjectives. Methods: Following a negative mood induction, 60 girls between the ages of 10 and 14 who had recurrent depressed mothers (high risk for depression) and 91 age-matched daughters of neverdisordered mothers (low risk for depression) completed a Self-Referent Encoding Task in which they decided whether negative and positive adjectives described them. Following the task they were asked to recall as many of the adjectives as they could. Results: Despite the absence of signiÔ¨Åcant group differences in endorsement of positive or negative adjectives, high-risk girls with the COMT Val158Met Val/Val polymorphism recalled more positive (but not negative) words that they had endorsed than did high-risk girls who were homozygous for the Met allele. COMT was not associated with recall of valenced adjectives in low-risk girls. Across risk groups, 5-HTTLPR polymorphism was not associated with recall of valenced adjectives. Limitations: Even with over 150 participants, there were relatively small numbers in some of the cells of this study, limiting its statistical power. Conclusions: These results suggest that assessing the interaction of familial risk status and COMT polymorphism is important in understanding the development of depressive disorders. \& 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore we examined validity effects for facial expressions of different emotions (compared to neutral faces) with a dot-probe paradigm in seven studies (total N = 308). Systematic variations of type of emotion, CTI, task, cue size, and masking allow for a differentiated assessment of attentional capture by emotions and possible moderating factors. Results indicate a general absence of emotional validity effects as well as a lack of significant interactions with either of the manipulated factors, indicating that facial expressions of emotions do not capture attention in a fully automatic fashion. These findings suggest that situational and contextual factors have to be taken into account when investigating attentional capture of emotional faces.},

	abstract = {Working memory (WM), the ability to store and manipulate information for short periods of time, is an important predictor of scholastic aptitude and a critical bottleneck underlying higher-order cognitive processes, including controlled attention and reasoning. Recent interventions targeting WM have suggested plasticity of the WM system by demonstrating improvements in both trained and untrained WM tasks. However, evidence on transfer of improved WM into more general cognitive domains such as fluid intelligence (Gf) has been more equivocal. Therefore, we conducted a metaanalysis focusing on one specific training program, n-back. We searched PubMed and Google Scholar for all n-back training studies with Gf outcome measures, a control group, and healthy participants between 18 and 50 years of age. In total, we included 20 studies in our analyses that met our criteria and found a small but significant positive effect of nback training on improving Gf. Several factors that moderate this transfer are identified and discussed. We conclude that short-term cognitive training on the order of weeks can result in beneficial effects in important cognitive functions as measured by laboratory tests.},

	abstract = {Efficient detection of threat provides obvious survival advantages and has resulted in a fast and accurate threatdetection system. Although beneficial under normal circumstances, this system may become hypersensitive and cause threat-processing abnormalities. Past research has shown that anxious individuals have difficulty disengaging attention from threatening faces, but it is unknown whether other forms of threatening social stimuli also influence attentional orienting. Much like faces, human body postures are salient social stimuli, because they are informative of one‚Äôs emotional state and next likely action. Additionally, postures can convey such information in situations in which another‚Äôs facial expression is not easily visible. Here we investigated whether there is a threat-specific effect for high-anxious individuals, by measuring the time that it takes the eyes to leave the attended stimulus, a task-irrelevant body posture. The results showed that relative to nonthreating postures, threat-related postures hold attention in anxious individuals, providing further evidence of an anxiety-related attentional bias for threatening information. This is the first study to demonstrate that attentional disengagement from threatening postures is affected by emotional valence in those reporting anxiety.},

This review moves beyond the problems thwarting correlational G √ó E research to propose genetic differential susceptibility experiments. G √ó E experiments can test the bright side as well as the dark side of the moderating role of genotypes traditionally considered to represent vulnerability to negative conditions. The differential susceptibility model predicts that carriers of these risk genotypes proÔ¨Åt most from interventions changing the environment for the better. The evolutionary background of G √ó E and differential susceptibility is discussed, and statistical methods for the analysis of differential susceptibility (versus diathesis stress) are reviewed. Then, based on results from 22 randomized G √ó E experiments, meta-analytic evidence for the differential susceptibility model is presented. Intervention effects are much stronger in the susceptible genotypes than in the nonsusceptible genotypes. The Ô¨Ånal sections suggest possibilities to broaden the G component in the G √ó E equation by including genetic pathways, and to broaden the E component by including methylation level and gene expression as promising ways to probe the concept of the environment more deeply and address the perennial issue of what works for whom.},

Behavioral results showed that while learning performance was balanced between the two groups, participants in the positive mood group had a higher learning rate than participants in the neutral mood group.

Neuropsychological models of antidepressant drug action suggest therapeutic effects might be mediated by the early correction of maladaptive biases in emotion processing, including the recognition of emotional expressions. Sub-chronic administration of duloxetine (for two weeks) produces adaptive changes in neural circuitry implicated in emotion processing; however, its effects on emotional expression recognition are unknown. Forty healthy participants were randomised to receive either 14 days of duloxetine (60 mg/day, titrated from 30 mg after three days) or matched placebo (with sham titration) in a double-blind, between-groups, repeated-measures design. On day 0 and day 14 participants completed a computerised emotional expression recognition task that measured sensitivity to the six primary emotions. Thirty-eight participants (19 per group) completed their course of tablets and were included in the analysis. Results provide evidence that duloxetine, compared to placebo, may reduce the accurate recognition of sadness. Drug effects were driven by changes in participants‚Äô ability to correctly detect subtle expressions of sadness, with greater change observed in the placebo relative to the duloxetine group. These effects occurred in the absence of changes in mood. Our preliminary findings require replication, but complement recent evidence that sadness recognition is a therapeutic target in major depression, and a mechanism through which SNRIs could resolve negative biases in emotion processing to achieve therapeutic effects.},

Using the Measure of Affect Regulation Styles (MARS; Larsen \& Prizmic, 2004) with 380 undergraduate students, analyses revealed nine affect regulation strategies (i.e., understanding/analyzing feelings, making plans, talking to someone, doing something enjoyable, being grateful, alcohol use, caffeine use, treating oneself, and consulting an advisor/mentor) that signiÔ¨Åcantly distinguished between languishing and non-languishing individuals (moderate and Ô¨Çourishing) and six affect regulation strategies (i.e., withdrawal, emotion suppression, keep to themselves, downward social comparison, eating something, and daydreaming) that signiÔ¨Åcantly distinguished Ô¨Çourishing individuals from those with moderate emotional health. SigniÔ¨Åcant differences between moderate and Ô¨Çourishing groups consisted of behaviors that ‚Äòprevented‚Äô rather than ‚Äòpromoted‚Äô Ô¨Çourishing (e.g., behavioral and cognitive avoidance). These Ô¨Åndings suggest that in order to achieve Ô¨Çourishing, individuals may need to reduce avoidance strategies and increase engagement strategies.},

An associative mode involves quick, effortless processing that rests on well-learned associations. A reflective mode involves slow, effortful processing that rests on symbolic rule-based inferences. Whereas the associative mode occurs automatically, the reflective mode operates when expectancies are violated and sufficient cognitive resources are available to respond. A cognitive vulnerability to depression is observed when negatively biased associative processing is uncorrected by reflective processing. The circumstances when this is likely to occur are reviewed.

Load was manipulated using a secondary auditory task requiring recognition of tones (low load), or recognition of speciÔ¨Åc tone pitch (high load). Results showed that load increased antisaccade latencies on trials where gaze toward face stimuli should be inhibited. This effect was exacerbated for high anxious individuals. Emotional expression also modulated task performance on antisaccade trials for both high and low anxious participants under low cognitive load, but did not inÔ¨Çuence performance under high load. Collectively, results (1) suggest that individuals reporting high levels of anxiety are particularly vulnerable to the effects of cognitive load on inhibition, and (2) support recent evidence that loading cognitive processes can reduce emotional inÔ¨Çuences on attention and cognition.},

Anticipatory preparation for an upcoming task switch is a hallmark of top-down intentional control. Meanwhile, asymmetries in performance and voluntary choice when switching between tasks differing in relative strength reveal the effects of between-task competition, reÔ¨Çected in a surprising bias against switching to an easier task. Here, we assessed the impact of this bias on EEG markers of intentional control during preparation for an upcoming task switch. The results revealed strong and varied effects of between-task competition on EEG markers of global task preparation‚Äîa frontal contingent negative variation (CNV), a posterior slow positive wave, and oscillatory activity in the alpha band (8‚Äì12 Hz) over posterior scalp sites. In contrast, we observed no between-task differences in motor-speciÔ¨Åc task preparation, as indexed by the lateralized readiness potential and by motor-related amplitude asymmetries in the mu (9‚Äì13 Hz) and beta (18‚Äì26 Hz) frequency bands.

The current study aimed to take a Ô¨Årst step in this direction by identifying a cognitive marker for optimism that could provide a modiÔ¨Åable target for innovative interventions. In particular we predicted that the ability to generate vivid positive mental imagery of the future would be associated with dispositional optimism. A community sample of 237 participants completed a survey comprising measures of mental imagery and optimism, and socio-demographic information. Vividness of positive future imagery was signiÔ¨Åcantly associated with optimism, even when adjusting for socio-demographic factors and everyday imagery use. The ability to generate vivid mental imagery of positive future events may provide a modiÔ¨Åable cognitive marker of optimism.

It is a core process in the choice of speciÔ¨Åc defenses, such as Ô¨Çight, freezing, defensive threat and defensive attack, that counter the threat and minimize the danger it poses. This highly adaptive process takes into account important characteristics, such as type and location (including distance from the subject) of the threat, as well as those (e.g. presence of an escape route or hiding place) of the situation, combining them to predict which speciÔ¨Åc defense is optimal with that particular combination of threat and situation. Risk assessment is particularly associated with ambiguity either of the threat stimulus or of the outcome of available defensive behaviors. It is also crucial in determining that threat is no longer present, permitting a return to normal, nondefensive behavior. Although risk assessment has been described in detail in rodents, it is also a feature of human defensive behavior, particularly in association with ambiguity. Rumination may be a speciÔ¨Åcally human form of risk assessment, more often expressed by women, and highly associated with anxiety.},

	abstract = {Background: According to the CONSORT statement, significance testing of baseline differences in randomized controlled trials should not be performed. In fact, this practice has been discouraged by numerous authors throughout the last forty years. During that time span, reporting of baseline differences has substantially decreased in the leading general medical journals. Our own experience in the field of nutrition behavior research however, is that co-authors, reviewers and even editors are still very persistent in their demand for these tests. The aim of this paper is therefore to negate this demand by providing clear evidence as to why testing for baseline differences between intervention groups statistically is superfluous and why such results should not be published. Discussion: Testing for baseline differences is often propagated because of the belief that it shows whether randomization was successful and it identifies real or important differences between treatment arms that should be accounted for in the statistical analyses. Especially the latter argument is flawed, because it ignores the fact that the prognostic strength of a variable is also important when the interest is in adjustment for confounding. In addition, including prognostic variables as covariates can increase the precision of the effect estimate. This means that choosing covariates based on significance tests for baseline differences might lead to omissions of important covariates and, less importantly, to inclusion of irrelevant covariates in the analysis. We used data from four supermarket trials on the effects of pricing strategies on fruit and vegetables purchases, to show that results from fully adjusted analyses sometimes do appreciably differ from results from analyses adjusted for significant baseline differences only. We propose to adjust for known or anticipated important prognostic variables. These could or should be pre-specified in trial protocols. Subsequently, authors should report results from the fully adjusted as well as crude analyses, especially for dichotomous and time to event data. Summary: Based on our arguments, which were illustrated by our findings, we propose that journals in and outside the field of nutrition behavior actively adopt the CONSORT 2010 statement on this topic by not publishing significance tests for baseline differences anymore.},

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a model of cognitive behavioral therapy that aims not only to reduce psychopathology but also to promote Ô¨Çourishing as well. This is the Ô¨Årst study to evaluate the impact of ACT on Ô¨Çourishing. A post-analysis was conducted on an earlier randomized controlled trial of a sample of adults with depressive symptomatology who participated in a guided self-help ACT intervention. This post-analysis showed a 5\%e28\% increase of Ô¨Çourishing by the participants. In addition, the effects on Ô¨Çourishing were maintained at the three-month follow-up. When compared to participants in a control group, the Ô¨Çourishing of the ACT-trained participants increased from 5\% to about 14\% after nine weeks. In addition to levels of positive mental health at baseline, an increase of psychological Ô¨Çexibility during the intervention was a signiÔ¨Åcant predictor of Ô¨Çourishing at the three-month follow-up.},

	abstract = {Researchers have documented the consequences of both expressing and suppressing emotion using between-subjects designs. It may be argued, however, that successful adaptation depends not so much on any one regulatory process, but on the ability to Ô¨Çexibly enhance or suppress emotional expression in accord with situational demands. We tested this hypothesis among New York City college students in the aftermath of the September 11th terrorist attacks. Subjects‚Äô performance in a laboratory task in which they enhanced emotional expression, suppressed emotional expression, and behaved normally on different trials was examined as a prospective predictor of their adjustment across the Ô¨Årst two years of college. Results supported the Ô¨Çexibility hypothesis. A regression analysis controlling for initial distress and motivation and cognitive resources found that subjects who were better able to enhance and suppress the expression of emotion evidenced less distress by the end of the second year. Memory deficits were also observed for both the enhancement and the suppression tasks, suggesting that both processes require cognitive resources.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the network approach to psychopathology has been advanced as an alternative way of conceptualizing mental disorders. In this approach, mental disorders arise from direct interactions between symptoms. Although the network approach has led to many novel methodologies and substantive applications, it has not yet been fully articulated as a scientiÔ¨Åc theory of mental disorders. The present paper aims to develop such a theory, by postulating a limited set of theoretical principles regarding the structure and dynamics of symptom networks. At the heart of the theory lies the notion that symptoms of psychopathology are causally connected through myriads of biological, psychological and societal mechanisms. If these causal relations are sufÔ¨Åciently strong, symptoms can generate a level of feedback that renders them self-sustaining. In this case, the network can get stuck in a disorder state. The network theory holds that this is a general feature of mental disorders, which can therefore be understood as alternative stable states of strongly connected symptom networks. This idea naturally leads to a comprehensive model of psychopathology, encompassing a common explanatory model for mental disorders, as well as novel deÔ¨Ånitions of associated concepts such as mental health, resilience, vulnerability and liability. In addition, the network theory has direct implications for how to understand diagnosis and treatment, and suggests a clear agenda for future research in psychiatry and associated disciplines.},

	abstract = {Emotion regulation describes how a subject can use certain strategies to aÔ¨Äect emotion response levels. Usually, models for emotion regulation assume mechanisms based on feedback loops that indicate how to change certain aspects of behavior or cognitive functioning in order to get a more satisfactory emotion response level. Adaptation of such feedback loops is usually left out of consideration. This paper introduces an adaptive computational model for emotion regulation by formalizing the model informally described by Gross (1998). The model has been constructed using a high-level modeling language, and integrates both quantitative aspects (such as levels of emotional response) and qualitative aspects (such as decisions to regulate one‚Äôs emotion). This model includes mechanisms for adaptivity of the degree of Ô¨Çexibility of the emotion regulation process. Also, the eÔ¨Äects of events like traumas or therapies on emotion regulation can be simulated. Based on this computational model, a number of simulation experiments have been performed and evaluated. √ì 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Processing of facial expressions of emotion is central to human interaction, and has important effects on behaviour and affective state. A range of methods and paradigms have been used to investigate various aspects of abnormal processing of facial expressions in major depression, including emotion specific deficits in recognition accuracy, response biases and attentional biases. The aim of this review is to examine and interpret data from studies of facial emotion processing in major depression, in the context of current knowledge about the neural correlates of facial expression processing of primary emotions. The review also discusses the methodologies used to examine facial expression processing. Studies of facial emotion processing and facial emotion recognition were identified up to December 2009 utilizing MEDLINE and Web of Science. Although methodological variations complicate interpretation of findings, there is reasonably consistent evidence of a negative response bias towards sadness in individuals with major depression, so that positive (happy), neutral or ambiguous facial expressions tend to be evaluated as more sad or less happy compared with healthy control groups. There is also evidence of increased vigilance and selective attention towards sad expressions and away from happy expressions, but less evidence of reduced general or emotion-specific recognition accuracy. Data is complicated by the use of multiple paradigms and the heterogeneity of major depression. Future studies should address methodological problems, including variations in patient characteristics, testing paradigms and procedures, and statistical methods used to analyse findings.},

The explicit memory test was incidental free recall following a self-referent encoding task. Subjects were divided into high and low negative affect groups, differing in trait and state anxiety, and depression scores. The high negative affect group showed greater subliminal priming of depression-relevant than neutral control words compared with the low negative affect group. This selective priming effect was more closely associated with depression than anxiety measures. There was little direct evidence of emotion-congruent biases on the supraliminally primed lexical decision and free recall tasks, although when the effects of anxiety were partialled out depression scores predicted relatively better recall of depression-relevant words.

Considering the functional links between perception, attention, and action regulation, we posit that when people can avoid the aversive consequences, sensitivity of the perceptual system to danger signals should be enhanced, whereas it should be reduced when there is no such option. To test this prediction, we used a search task in which tachistoscopically presented conjunctions of features had to be detected. Parameters of sensitivity and response bias were analyzed drawing on procedures from signal detection theory. Although the experimental procedure rewarded correct responses, the predicted asymmetry emerged. For stimuli that were linked to a negative consequence (loss of points in the experimental game), perceptual sensitivity was enhanced when participants had the opportunity to neutralize the loss in a second task; an opposite pattern emerged when they had no such opportunity.},

	abstract = {Memory impairment is the most commonly reported cognitive symptom associated with major depressive disorder. Decreased hippocampal volume and neurogenesis in depression link hippocampal dysfunction with deÔ¨Åcits in memory. Stress decreases hippocampal dendritic spine density and long-term potentiation (LTP) at glutamate synapses, a cellular correlate of learning and memory. However, elevated plasma levels of 17b estradiol (E2) during proestrus increase hippocampal structure and function, directly opposing the negative consequences of stress. In women, signiÔ¨Åcant Ô¨Çuctuations in ovarian hormones likely increase vulnerability of hippocampal circuits to stress, potentially contributing to the greater incidence of depression compared to men. Using the learned helplessness model of depression and ovariectomized female rats, we investigated whether acquisition of helplessness and hippocampal synaptic dysfunction is differentially impacted by the presence or absence of plasma E2. We Ô¨Ånd that inescapable shock induces a greater incidence of helplessness in vehicle- versus E2-treated OVX rats. In the vehicletreated group, LTP was absent at CA3-CA1 synapses in slices only from helpless rats, and CA1 spine density was decreased compared to resilient rats. In contrast, signiÔ¨Åcant LTP was observed in slices from E2-treated helpless rats; importantly, spine density was not different between E2treated helpless and resilient rats, dissociating spine density from the LTP magnitude. We also Ô¨Ånd that E2 replacement can reverse previously established helpless behavior. Thus, our results show that E2 replacement in OVX rats increases resilience and improves hippocampal plasticity, suggesting that E2 therapy may increase resilience to stress and preserve hippocampal function in women experiencing large Ô¨Çuctuations in plasma estrogen levels.},

It remains unclear, however, whether socially anxious individuals are in fact more sensitive to disapproving emotions. We assessed decoding of, and cost attributions to, emotional expressions in high and low socially anxious females (n ¬º102) using Ô¨Åve emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, and sadness) expressed at 15 intensities (9‚Äì65\%), providing 75 stimuli (see Supplementary Material). The decoding task brieÔ¨Çy presented the stimuli and participants identiÔ¨Åed the emotion. The cost attribution task asked individuals to rate each stimulus for how costly it would be for them to interact with the person. Random effects regression indicated that social anxiety was not associated with overall decoding accuracy but was associated with a response bias. High socially anxious individuals had a lower threshold for decoding emotions but also more frequently classiÔ¨Åed low intensity emotions incorrectly. These effects were not emotion-speciÔ¨Åc. Socially anxious individuals also attributed excessive social cost to expressions of negative valence. Our results provide a novel conceptual framework for understanding emotion decoding in social anxiety, indicating the importance of considering both accuracy and response bias.},

The aim of this paper was to investigate whether and how routine activities promote flourishing. The authors proposed that flourishers thrive because they capitalize on the processes featured in the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions, specifically by experiencing greater positive emotional reactivity to pleasant events and building more resources over time. To test these hypotheses, the Day Reconstruction Method (DRM) was administered to a prescreened community sample of adults (n œ≠ 208), and they were recontacted two to three months later. Results showed that relative to those who did not flourish or were depressed, people who flourish generally responded with bigger ‚Äúboosts‚Äù in positive emotions in response to everyday, pleasant events (helping, interacting, playing, learning, spiritual activity), and this greater positive emotional reactivity, over time, predicted higher levels of two facets of the cognitive resource of mindfulness. In turn, these higher levels of mindfulness were positively associated with higher levels of flourishing at the end of study, controlling for initial levels of flourishing. These results suggest that the promotion of well-being may be fueled by small, yet consequential differences in individuals‚Äô emotional experience of pleasant everyday events. Additionally, these results underscore the utility of the broadenand-build theory in understanding the processes by which flourishing is promoted and provide support for a positive potentiation perspective.},

They also assessed state anxiety and satisfaction with life concurrently and 3 weeks later. Controlling for concurrent anxiety, a fear-induced shift in attention to threatening cues was associated with increased levels of later anxiety. Controlling for concurrent life satisfaction, a happiness-induced shift in attention to emotional cues (both threatening and pleasant) was associated with increased levels of later life satisfaction.

	abstract = {Animals that experience adverse events in early life often have life-long changes to their physiology and behavior. Long-term effects of stress during early life have been studied extensively, but less attention has been given to the consequences of negative experiences solely during the adolescent phase. Adolescence is a particularly sensitive period of life when regulation of the glucocorticoid ‚Äústress‚Äù hormone response matures and speciÔ¨Åc regions in the brain undergo considerable change. Aversive experiences during this time might, therefore, be expected to generate long-term consequences for the adult phenotype. Here we investigated the long-term effects of exposure to chronic unpredictable stress during adolescence on adult decision-making, coping response, cognitive bias, and exploratory behavior in rats. Rats exposed to chronic unpredictable stress (e.g., isolation, crowding, cage tilt) were compared to control animals that were maintained in standard, predictable conditions throughout development. Unpredictable stress during adolescence resulted in a suite of long-term behavioral and cognitive changes including a negative cognitive bias [F(1, 12) = 5.000, P {\textbackslash}textless 0.05], altered coping response [T(1,14) = 2.216, P = 0.04], and accelerated decision-making [T(1,14) = 3.245, P = 0.01]. Exposure to chronic stress during adolescence also caused a short-term increase in boldness behaviors; in a novel object test 15 days after the last stressor, animals exposed to chronic unpredictable stress had decreased latencies to leave a familiar shelter and approach a novel object [T(1,14) = 2.240, P = 0.04; T(1,14) = 2.419, P = 0.03, respectively]. The results showed that stress during adolescence has long-term impacts on behavior and cognition that affect the interpretation of ambiguous stimuli, behavioral response to adverse events, and how animals make decisions.},

	abstract = {In a dot-probe task, two cues‚Äîone emotional and one neutral‚Äîare followed by a probe in one of their locations. Faster responses to probes co-located with the emotional stimulus are taken as evidence of attentional bias. Several studies indicate that such attentional bias measures have poor reliability, even though ERP studies show that people reliably attend to the emotional stimulus. This inconsistency might arise because the emotional stimulus captures attention briefly (as indicated by ERP), but cues appear for long enough that attention can be redistributed before the probe onset, causing RT measures of bias to vary across trials. We tested this hypothesis by manipulating SOA (stimulus onset asynchrony between onset of the cues and onset of the probe) in a dot-probe task using angry and neutral faces. Across three experiments, the internal reliability of behavioural biases was significantly greater than zero when probes followed faces by 100 ms, but not when the SOA was 300, 500, or 900 ms. Thus, the initial capture of attention shows some level of consistency, but this diminishes quickly. Even at the shortest SOA internal reliability estimates were poor, and not sufficient to justify the use of the task as an index of individual differences in attentional bias.},

A non-clinical sample of participants was randomly assigned to receive either ABM or a placebo task. To assess pre‚Äìpost changes in attentional control, participants were additionally administered an emotional antisaccade task. ABM participants exhibited a subsequent shift in attentional bias away from threat as expected. ABM participants further showed a subsequent decrease in antisaccade cost, indicating a general facilitation of inhibitory attentional control. Mediational analysis revealed that the shift in attentional bias following ABM was independent to the change in attentional control.

The present study sought to examine whether such anxiety-linked attentional biases were associated with either stimulus driven or attentional control mechanisms of attentional selectivity. High and low trait anxious participants completed an emotional variant of an antisaccade task, in which they were required to prosaccade towards, or antisaccade away from a positive, neutral or threat stimulus, while eye movements were recorded. While low anxious participants were found to be slower to saccade in response to positive stimuli, irrespectively of whether a pro- or antisaccade was required, such a bias was absent in high anxious individuals. Analysis of erroneous antisaccades further revealed at trend level, that anxiety was associated with reduced peak velocity in response to threat. The findings suggest that anxiety is associated with the aberrant processing of positive stimuli, and greater compensatory efforts in the inhibition of threat. The findings further highlight the relevance of considering saccade peak velocity in the assessment of anxiety-linked attentional processing.},

	abstract = {Background: Stress plays an important role in the onset and recurrence of bipolar disorder (BD). Resilience is the ability to cope with stress or adversity. Few studies have examined resilience in BD, and this study aimed to investigate the clinical correlates of resilience in euthymic patients with BD. Methods: A total of 62 outpatients with BD type I, II, and not otherwise speciÔ¨Åed (NOS) who were in remission and 62 healthy individuals matched with the BD group in terms of age and sex were recruited. All participants completed the Connor‚ÄìDavidson Resilience Scale and Barratt Impulsiveness Scale. A psychiatrist interviewed the subjects to assess clinical characteristics. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with resilience. Results: The BD group had signiÔ¨Åcantly higher levels of impulsivity and lower levels of resilience compared with the control group. Degree of impulsivity, number of depressive episodes, Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scores, and length of education were signiÔ¨Åcantly correlated with resilience. Attention impulsivity, non-planning impulsivity, and number of depressive episodes were associated with low levels of resilience, even when age, sex, length of education, and CGI scores were controlled. Limitations: Because tertiary hospital patients were recruited, the generalizability of the Ô¨Åndings is limited. Conclusions: This study shows that low levels of resilience are related to high levels of impulsivity and to an increased number of depressive episodes in euthymic patients with BD. Given the reciprocal relationship between resilience and impulsivity, efforts to enhance resilience and reduce impulsivity may make important contributions to the treatment of patients with BD.},

Facilitated attention, difÔ¨Åculty in disengagement, and attentional avoidance comprise the components of attentional bias. A threat detection mechanism likely underlies facilitated attention, a process that may be neurally centered around the amygdala. Attentional control ability likely underlies difÔ¨Åculty in disengagement, emotion regulation goals likely underlie attentional avoidance, and both of these processes may be neurally centered around prefrontal cortex functioning. The threat detection mechanism may be a mostly automatic process, attentional avoidance may be a mostly strategic process, and difÔ¨Åculty in disengagement may be a mixture of automatic and strategic processing.

Cross-lagged analyses produced a statistically signiÔ¨Åcant association between psychological stress and one allostatic load component (primary mediators). Psychological stress was a better predictor of primary mediators than environmental stress. Primary mediators rose with time for caregivers, but not for non-caregivers. A greater rise was evident for caregivers who had relinquished their role by the second year, although the level of psychological stress actually declined. Primary mediators are a key component of the relationship between allostatic load and prior stress. When allostatic load is treated as an outcome of stress, it is important to distinguish environmental and psychological stress.},

	abstract = {Although people differ in their susceptibility to elevate trait anxiety in response to extended stress, little is known about the cognitive substrate of this particular individual difference. We report three studies designed to evaluate the hypothesis that individual differences in readiness to acquire an attentional bias toward threat cues, in response to a contingency that makes the acquisition of such a bias adaptive, underlie individual differences in susceptibility to elevate trait anxiety in response to extended stress. Our findings confirm that the ease with which such a threat bias can be transiently evoked by experimental conditions that encourage its acquisition predicts the degree to which trait anxiety later becomes elevated by extended exposure to a mild stressor. Furthermore, this reflects the fact that such early measures of attentional bias plasticity predict the later naturalistic acquisition of attentional bias in response to subsequent stress, which in turn is associated with a consequent increase in trait anxiety level. These findings are consistent with our proposed account of individual differences in susceptibility to elevate trait anxiety in response to stress.},

Methods are taught under the assumption that a researcher already knows the research question and knows which methods will fit that question.

In this paper, we first discuss how to get an idea that is worth researching. We describe sources of new ideas and how to foster a creative attitude by ‚Äúcultivating your thoughts‚Äù. Only a few of these ideas will make it into a study. Next, we describe how to sharpen and focus a research question so that a study becomes feasible and a valid test of the underlying idea. To do this, the idea needs to be ‚Äúpruned‚Äù. Pruning a research question means cutting away anything that is unnecessary, so that only the essence remains. This includes determining both the latent and the stated objectives, specific pruning questions, and the use of specific schemes to structure reasoning. After this, the following steps include preparation of a brief protocol, conduct of a pilot study, and writing a draft of the paper including draft tables.

To test this hypothesis, the authors measured emotions daily for 1 month in a sample of students (N œ≠ 86) and assessed life satisfaction and trait resilience at the beginning and end of the month. Positive emotions predicted increases in both resilience and life satisfaction. Negative emotions had weak or null effects and did not interfere with the benefits of positive emotions. Positive emotions also mediated the relation between baseline and final resilience, but life satisfaction did not. This suggests that it is in-the-moment positive emotions, and not more general positive evaluations of one‚Äôs life, that form the link between happiness and desirable life outcomes. Change in resilience mediated the relation between positive emotions and increased life satisfaction, suggesting that happy people become more satisfied not simply because they feel better but because they develop resources for living well.},

This paper reviews and synthesizes evidence for explicit (conscious) and implicit (unconscious) memory biases in the anxiety disorders. Our review suggests variations among the anxiety disorders for explicit memory biases. Specifically, there is support for explicit memory biases for threat-relevant information in panic disorder (PD), particularly when information has been deeply encoded, but not in social phobia (SP) or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The few available studies suggest the presence of explicit memory biases in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and obsessive ‚Äì compulsive disorder (OCD), but further research is needed. In contrast, some degree of support for implicit memory biases has been demonstrated for each of the anxiety disorders. Inconsistencies in the existing literature, topics worthy of future research attention, and directions for revising existing information-processing models of anxiety are discussed.

Using the AX-CPT cognitive control task as a case study example, we address four concerns that one may encounter when researching the topic of individual differences in cognition. First, we demonstrate the importance of variability in task scores, which in turn directly impacts reliability, particularly when comparing correlations in different populations. Second, we demonstrate the importance of variability and reliability for evaluating potential failures to replicate predicted correlations, even within the same population. Third, we demonstrate how researchers can turn to evaluating psychometric properties as a way of evaluating the feasibility of utilizing the task in new settings (e.g., online administration). Lastly, we show how the examination of psychometric properties can help researchers make informed decisions when designing a study, such as determining the appropriate number of trials for a task.},

Combined training resulted in continued reduction in worry in the week after training, highlighting the potential of utilising n-back training as an adjunct to established clinical treatment.

This literature falls short of addressing whether the effects of CBM-I extend to worries about a real-life stressor, such as a school transition. Design: The study comprised a between-groups design comparing the effects of CBM-I to an active control (AC) intervention in children. Method: We recruited 38 children within two months of their primary‚Äìsecondary school transition and investigated the capacity for multisession, parent-administered CBM-I, compared to an AC condition, to modify cognitive style and reduce anxiety symptoms and school concerns. Results: While benign interpretations increased signiÔ¨Åcantly and negative interpretations tended to decrease following CBM-I, both interventions signiÔ¨Åcantly reduced anxiety symptoms and school concerns. Conclusions: These Ô¨Åndings indicate that anxiety-reducing effects of CBM-I in children extend to a real life stressful event, but that equivalent anxiety reduction may be achieved through exposure to potentially worrying situations and parent‚Äìchild interaction in the absence of bias modiÔ¨Åcation.},

Using the challenge‚Äì hindrance stressor framework (Cavanaugh, Boswell, Roehling, \& Boudreau, 2000), we propose that challenge stressors have the potential to promote the capacity for resilience, whereas hindrance stressors experienced in the workplace erode resilient functioning. Employing a 2-wave longitudinal design we examined the effects of challenge and hindrance stressors on psychological resilience and strain 3 months later. Two-hundred and 8 working adults (48.1\% female) participated in both surveys. Findings indicated that Time 1 challenge stressors had a significant effect on psychological resilience 3 months later (Time 2). In contrast, Time 1 hindrance stressors positively predicted Time 2 strain and negatively predicted psychological resilience. Moreover, resilience mediated the relationship between Time 1 stressors and Time 2 strain. These results demonstrate the potential positive and negative impacts of workplace stressor types on psychological resilience, and provide an exploration of a mechanism through which challenge and hindrance stressors influence well-being. This analysis also investigated the role of resilience in moderating the relationship between hindrances and strain. Some evidence emerged for the moderating role of resilience in the hindrance‚Äìstrain relationship. The implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.},

Cross-sectional, correlational and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Methods. The DASS was administered to a non-clinical sample, broadly representative of the general adult UK population (N = 1,771) in terms of demographic variables. Competing models of the latent structure of the DASS were derived from theoretical and empirical sources and evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis. Correlational analysis was used to determine the influence of demographic variables on DASS scores. The convergent and discriminant validity of the measure was examined through correlating the measure with two other measures of depression and anxiety (the HADS and the sAD), and a measure of positive and negative affectivity (the PANAS). Results. The best fitting model (CFI = .93) of the latent structure of the DASS consisted of three correlated factors corresponding to the depression, anxiety and stress scales with correlated error permitted between items comprising the DASS subscales. Demographic variables had only very modest influences on DASS scores. The reliability of the DASS was excellent, and the measure possessed adequate convergent and discriminant validity Conclusions. The DASS is a reliable and valid measure of the constructs it was intended to assess. The utility of this measure for UK clinicians is enhanced by the provision of large sample normative data.},

	abstract = {Researchers designing experiments in which a sample of participants responds to a sample of stimuli are faced with difficult questions about optimal study design. The conventional procedures of statistical power analysis fail to provide appropriate answers to these questions because they are based on statistical models in which stimuli are not assumed to be a source of random variation in the data, models that are inappropriate for experiments involving crossed random factors of participants and stimuli. In this article, we present new methods of power analysis for designs with crossed random factors, and we give detailed, practical guidance to psychology researchers planning experiments in which a sample of participants responds to a sample of stimuli. We extensively examine 5 commonly used experimental designs, describe how to estimate statistical power in each, and provide power analysis results based on a reasonable set of default parameter values. We then develop general conclusions and formulate rules of thumb concerning the optimal design of experiments in which a sample of participants responds to a sample of stimuli. We show that in crossed designs, statistical power typically does not approach unity as the number of participants goes to infinity but instead approaches a maximum attainable power value that is possibly small, depending on the stimulus sample. We also consider the statistical merits of designs involving multiple stimulus blocks. Finally, we provide a simple and flexible Web-based power application to aid researchers in planning studies with samples of stimuli.},

	abstract = {Recent research into population standards of life satisfaction has revealed a remarkable level of uniformity, with the mean values for Western populations clustering at around three-quarters of the measurement scale maximum. While this seems to suggest the presence of a homeostatic mechanism for life satisfaction, the character of such a hypothetical device is uncertain. This paper proposes that well-being homeostasis is controlled by positive cognitive biases pertaining to the self. Most particular in this regard are the positive biases in relation to self-esteem, control and optimism. Past controversies in relation to this proposition are reviewed and resolved in favour of the proposed mechanism. The empirical data to support this hypothesis are discussed in the context of perceived well-being as an adaptive human attribute.},

The present study sought to investigate internal cognitive control impairments related to emotional information and task settings in clinical depression (MDD, major depressive disorder). Internal cognitive control was operationalized as switching between internally held mental representations that required continuous updating in working memory and measured with the Internal Shift Task (IST). The results showed that MDD individuals were characterized by a general switching impairment. This switching impairment was neither inÔ¨Çuenced by the task-relevance of emotional information, nor inÔ¨Çuenced by the valence of the faces within the emotion condition. The impairment in cognitive control reÔ¨Çected in general switching impairments was related to rumination, a speciÔ¨Åc cognitive symptom and important risk factor of depression. The results of this study offer new insights into the relationship between depression and impaired cognitive control with potential clinical implications, informing treatment and prevention programmes.},

	abstract = {Background and objectives: For decades, the dominant paradigm in trait anxiety research has regarded the construct as signifying the underlying cause of the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that supposedly reflect its presence. Recently, a network theory of personality has appeared. According to this perspective, trait anxiety is a formative construct emerging from interactions among its constitutive features (e.g., thought, feelings, behaviors); it is not a latent cause of these features. Design: In this study, we characterized trait anxiety as a network system of interacting elements. Methods: To do so, we estimated a graphical gaussian model via the computation of a regularized partial correlation network in an unselected sample (N = 611). We also implemented modularity-based community detection analysis to test whether the features of trait anxiety cohere as a single network system. Results: We find that trait anxiety can indeed be conceptualized as a single, coherent network system of interacting elements. Conclusions: This radically new approach to visualizing trait anxiety may offer an especially informative view of the interplay between its constitutive features. As prior research has implicated trait anxiety as a risk factor for the development of anxiety-related psychopathology, our findings also set the scene for novel research directions.},

A double dissociation was observed. The SERT polymorphism altered behavioral adaptation after losses, with increased lose-shift associated with L0 homozygosity, while leaving unaffected perseveration after reversal. In contrast, the DAT1 genotype affected the inÔ¨Çuence of prior choices on perseveration, while leaving lose-shifting unaltered. A model of reinforcement learning captured the dose-dependent effect of DAT1 genotype, such that an increasing number of 9R-alleles resulted in a stronger reliance on previous experience and therefore reluctance to update learned associations. These data provide direct evidence for doubly dissociable effects of serotonin and dopamine systems.},

The scale is substantially correlated with other psychological well-being scales, but is briefer. The scale provides a single overall psychological well-being score and does not yield scores for various components of well-being. The Scale of Positive and Negative Experience (SPANE) yields a score for positive experience and feelings (6 items), a score for negative experience and feelings (6 items), and the two can be combined to create an experience balance score. This 12-item brief scale has a number of desirable features compared to earlier measures of positive and negative feelings. In particular, the scale assesses with a few items a broad range of negative and positive experiences and feelings, not just those of a certain type, and is based on the frequency of feelings during the past month. A scale to measure Positive Thinking is also presented. Basic psychometric statistics are presented for the scales based on 573 college students at Ô¨Åve universities.},

Across the globe, the association of log income with subjective well-being was linear but convex with raw income, indicating the declining marginal effects of income on subjective well-being. Income was a moderately strong predictor of life evaluation but a much weaker predictor of positive and negative feelings. Possessing luxury conveniences and satisfaction with standard of living were also strong predictors of life evaluation. Although the meeting of basic and psychological needs mediated the effects of income on life evaluation to some degree, the strongest mediation was provided by standard of living and ownership of conveniences. In contrast, feelings were most associated with the fulfillment of psychological needs: learning, autonomy, using one‚Äôs skills, respect, and the ability to count on others in an emergency. Thus, two separate types of prosperity‚Äî economic and social psychological‚Äî best predict different types of well-being.},

This multi-disciplinary review explores past attempts to define wellbeing and provides an overview of the main theoretical perspectives, from the work of Aristotle to the present day. The article argues that many attempts at expressing its nature have focused purely on dimensions of wellbeing, rather than on definition. Among these theoretical perspectives, we highlight the pertinence of dynamic equilibrium theory of wellbeing (Headey \& Wearing, 1989), the effect of life challenges on homeostasis (Cummins, 2010) and the lifespan model of development (Hendry \& Kloep, 2002). Consequently, we conclude that it would be appropriate for a new definition of wellbeing to centre on a state of equilibrium or balance that can be affected by life events or challenges. The article closes by proposing this new definition, which we believe to be simple, universal in application, optimistic and a basis for measurement. This definition conveys the multi-faceted nature of wellbeing and can help individuals and policy makers move forward in their understanding of this popular term.},

Rumination has been found to mediate cross-sectional and prospective relations between anxiety and depressive symptoms in adolescents and adults. We examined whether rumination and worry, both forms of repetitive negative thinking, also explain the associations between affective disorders. This was studied using a prospective cohort study. In a mixed sample of 2981 adults (persons with a prior history of or a current affective disorder and healthy individuals) we assessed DSM-IV affective disorders (CIDI), rumination (LEIDS-R) and worry (PSWQ). All measures were repeated 2 years and 4 years later. Using structural equation models, we found that baseline rumination and worry partly mediated the association of baseline fear disorders (social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia) with distress disorders (dysthymia, major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder). Moreover, baseline fear disorders predicted changes in distress disorders and changes in worry and rumination mediated these associations. The association between baseline distress disorders and changes in fear disorders was mediated by changes in rumination but not by changes in worry. From these results it can be concluded that repetitive negative thinking is an important transdiagnostic factor. Rumination and worry are partly responsible for the cross-sectional and prospective co-occurrence of affective disorders and may be suitable targets for treatment.},

This study tested the hypothesis that this attentional focus toward mother occurs at the expense of attentional exploration of the environment. Ninety children, aged 8 ‚Äì12, completed questionnaires assessing trust in maternal support, watched a video that induced mild fear of dogs, and completed a dot probe computer task assessing attentional processing of simultaneously presented pictures of mother and pictures of the threatening stimulus (i.e., dogs). Less trust in maternal support was linked to a stronger attentional focus toward the mother pictures versus the dog pictures. These results suggest that, in the presence of mother, children with more secure attachment expectations are better able to freely explore a mildly threatening environment.},

The evolutionary model contends that understanding the evolutionary functions of adolescence is critical to explaining why adolescents engage in risky behavior and that successful intervention depends on working with, instead of against, adolescent goals and motivations. The current article articulates 5 key evolutionary insights into risky adolescent behavior: (a) The adolescent transition is an inflection point in development of social status and reproductive trajectories; (b) interventions need to address the adaptive functions of risky and aggressive behaviors like bullying; (c) risky adolescent behavior adaptively calibrates over development to match both harsh and unpredictable environmental conditions; (d) understanding evolved sex differences is critical for understanding the psychology of risky behavior; and (e) mismatches between current and past environments can dysregulate adolescent behavior, as demonstrated by age-segregated social groupings. The evolutionary model has broad implications for designing interventions for high-risk youth and suggests new directions for research that have not been forthcoming from other perspectives.},

	abstract = {The usage of psychological networks that conceptualize behaviour as a complex interplay of psychological and other components has gained increasing popularity in various research Ô¨Åelds. While prior publications have tackled the topics of estimating and interpreting such networks, little work has been conducted to check how accurate (i.e., prone to sampling variation) networks are estimated, and how stable (i.e., interpretation remains similar with less observations) inferences from the network structure (such as centrality indices) are. In this tutorial paper, we aim to introduce the reader to this Ô¨Åeld and tackle the problem of accuracy under sampling variation. We Ô¨Årst introduce the current state-of-the-art of network estimation. Second, we provide a rationale why researchers should investigate the accuracy of psychological networks. Third, we describe how bootstrap routines can be used to (A) assess the accuracy of estimated network connections, (B) investigate the stability of centrality indices, and (C) test whether network connections and centrality estimates for diÔ¨Äerent variables diÔ¨Äer from each other. We introduce two novel statistical methods: for (B) the correlation stability coeÔ¨Écient, and for (C) the bootstrapped diÔ¨Äerence test for edge-weights and centrality indices. We conducted and present simulation studies to assess the performance of both methods. Finally, we developed the free R-package bootnet that allows for estimating psychological networks in a generalized framework in addition to the proposed bootstrap methods. We showcase bootnet in a tutorial, accompanied by R syntax, in which we analyze a dataset of 359 women with posttraumatic stress disorder available online.},

A wide variety of matrices that are used in statistics can be represented in this fashion, for example matrices that contain (implied) covariances, factor loadings, regression parameters and p values. qgraph can also be used as a psychometric tool, as it performs exploratory and conÔ¨Årmatory factor analysis, using sem and lavaan; the output of these packages is automatically visualized in qgraph, which may aid the interpretation of results.

Forty-nine individuals encoded emotionally positive and negative meanings derived from ambiguous information and then searched their memory for encoded meanings in response to a set of retrieval cues. The remember/know/new procedure was used to classify memories as recollection-based or familiaritybased, and gaze behavior was monitored throughout the task to measure attentional allocation. We found that a bias in sustained attention during recollection-based, but not familiarity-based, retrieval predicted subsequent memory bias toward positive versus negative material following encoding. Thus, during emotional memory retrieval, attention affects controlled forms of retrieval (i.e., recollection) but does not modulate relatively automatic, familiarity-based retrieval. These findings enhance understanding of how distinct components of attention regulate the emotional content of memories. Implications for theoretical models and emotion regulation are discussed.},

It is assumed that anxiety impairs efficient functioning of the goal-directed attentional system and increases the extent to which processing is influenced by the stimulus-driven attentional system. In addition to decreasing attentional control, anxiety increases attention to threat-related stimuli. Adverse effects of anxiety on processing efficiency depend on two central executive functions involving attentional control: inhibition and shifting. However, anxiety may not impair performance effectiveness (quality of performance) when it leads to the use of compensatory strategies (e.g., enhanced effort; increased use of processing resources).

Data revealed a unidimensional of a 20-item ACS. It can be used validly to assess long-term individual differences in attentional skills related to the voluntary executive functions. The analysis of content, internal and construct validity as well as reliability provided evidence of the scale‚Äôs signiÔ¨Åcant convergent and discriminant validity when correlated with attentional tests and other personality techniques. We found strong, systematic relations between the attentional control and selected measures of temperament, arousal, emotionality, and motivation. The results allow assuming that good attentional control, may protect individuals from the emotional disorders by regulating perceptual, conceptual, and response processing.},

In some cases acute or chronic stress leads to depression and other psychiatric disorders, but most people are resilient to such effects. Recent research has begun to identify the environmental, genetic, epigenetic and neural mechanisms that underlie resilience, and has shown that resilience is mediated by adaptive changes in several neural circuits involving numerous neurotransmitter and molecular pathways. These changes shape the functioning of the neural circuits that regulate reward, fear, emotion reactivity and social behaviour, which together are thought to mediate successful coping with stress.},

We consider whether child development has no impact on information processing biases to threat (integral bias model), or whether child development inÔ¨Çuences information processing biases and if so whether it does so by moderating the expression of an existing bias (moderation model) or by affecting the acquisition of a bias (acquisition model). We examine the extent to which these models Ô¨Åt with existing theory and research evidence and outline some methodological issues that need to be considered when drawing conclusions about the potential role of child development in the information processing of threat stimuli.

It is not clear whether this bias is: 1) related to the physiological response to stressful events, and 2) causally related to the development of anxiety disorders. Methods: We tested the predictive value of both preconscious and conscious attention biases in a prospective study of stress reactivity in a nonclinical sample. One hundred four male participants were assessed at baseline and then again 4 months (n œ≠ 82) and 8 months later (n œ≠ 70). Salivary cortisol and self-report measures were obtained at the baseline testing session in addition to measures of biased attention. Subsequent emotional reactivity was assessed by means of salivary cortisol and self-reported state-anxiety responses during a laboratorybased stressor (4 months later) as well as during a real-life stressor 8 months later (i.e., examination period). Results: Regression analyses indicated that a preconscious negative processing bias was the best predictor of the cortisol response to stressful events. Importantly, a measure of selective processing provided a better indicator of subsequent emotional reactivity than self-report measures of neuroticism, trait-anxiety, and extraversion. Conclusions: These results suggest that preconscious biases toward negative material play a causal role in heightened anxiety vulnerability. Our results illustrate the potential utility of preconscious biases in attention in providing an early marker of anxiety vulnerability and a potential target for treatment intervention.},

	abstract = {Background: Attention bias modiÔ¨Åcation (ABM) procedures have been shown to modify biased attention with important implications for emotional vulnerability and resilience. The use of ABM to reduce potentially toxic biases, for instance, is a newly emerging therapy for anxiety disorders. A separate line of gene-by-environment interaction research proposes that many so-called vulnerability genes or risk alleles are better seen as plasticity genes, as they seem to make individuals more susceptible to environmental inÔ¨Çuences for better and for worse. Methods: A standard ABM procedure was used with a sample of 116 healthy adults. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two training groups. One received an ABM procedure designed to induce a bias in attention toward negative material, while the other was trained toward positive pictures. Individuals with low- and high-expressing forms of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) were compared. Results: Those with a low-expression form (S/S, S/Lg, or Lg/Lg) of the 5-HTTLPR gene developed stronger biases for both negative and positive affective pictures relative to those with the high-expression (La/La) form of the gene. Conclusions: Here, we report the Ô¨Årst evidence that allelic variation in the promotor region of the 5-HTTLPR gene predicts different degrees of sensitivity to ABM. These results suggest a potential cognitive mechanism for the gene-by-environment interactions that have been found in relation to the serotonin transporter gene. Variation on this genotype may therefore determine who will beneÔ¨Åt most (and least) from therapeutic interventions, adversity, and supportive environments.},

For the problem of recovering the graphical structure, information criteria provide useful optimization objectives for algorithms searching through sets of graphs or for selection of tuning parameters of other methods such as the graphical lasso, which is a likelihood penalization technique. In this paper we establish the consistency of an extended Bayesian information criterion for Gaussian graphical models in a scenario where both the number of variables p and the sample size n grow. Compared to earlier work on the regression case, our treatment allows for growth in the number of non-zero parameters in the true model, which is necessary in order to cover connected graphs. We demonstrate the performance of this criterion on simulated data when used in conjunction with the graphical lasso, and verify that the criterion indeed performs better than either cross-validation or the ordinary Bayesian information criterion when p and the number of non-zero parameters q both scale with n.},

	abstract = {The dot-probe task is often considered a gold standard in the Ô¨Åeld for investigating attentional bias to threat. However, serious issues with the task have been raised. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, a number of studies have demonstrated that the traditional reaction time (RT) measure of attentional bias to threat in the dot-probe task has poor internal reliability and poor test-retest reliability. In addition, although threatening stimuli capture attention in other paradigms, attentional bias to threat has not usually been found in typical research participants in the dot-probe task. However, when attention is measured in the dotprobe task with the N2pc component of the event-related potential waveform, substantial attentional orienting to threat is observed, and the internal reliability is moderate. To provide a rigorous comparison of the reliability of this N2pc measure and the conventional behavioral measure, as well as to examine the relationship of these measures to anxiety, the present study examined the N2pc in conjunction with RT in the dot-probe task in a large sample of participants (N = 96). As in previous studies, RT showed no bias to threatening images across the sample and exhibited poor internal reliability. Moreover, this measure did not relate to trait anxiety. By contrast, the N2pc revealed a signiÔ¨Åcant initial shift of attention to threat, and this measure was internally reliable. However, the N2pc was not correlated with trait anxiety, indicating that it does not provide a meaningful index of individual differences in anxiety in the dot-probe task. Together, these results indicate a serious need to develop new tasks and methods to more reliably investigate attentional bias to threat and its relationship to anxiety in both clinical and non-clinical populations.},

Yet there has been little investigation of task manipulations that can experimentally modulate the use of proactive control in healthy young adults; such manipulations could be useful to better understand the workings of cognitive control mechanisms. In the current study, a series of three experiments demonstrate how individuals can be systematically biased toward and away from the utilization of proactive control, via strategy training and no-go manipulations, respectively.

With the help of simulated longitudinal data of body mass index in children, we review statistical methods for the analysis of the association between the baseline value and subsequent change, assuming linear growth with time. Key issues in such analyses are mathematical coupling, measurement error, variability of change between individuals, and regression to the mean. Ideally, it is better to rely on multiple repeated measurements at different times and a linear random effects model is a standard approach if more than two waves of data are available. If only two waves of data are available, our simulations show that Blomqvist‚Äôs method ‚Äì which consists in adjusting for measurement error variance the estimated regression coefÔ¨Åcient of observed change on baseline value ‚Äì provides accurate estimates.

First, natural selection may favor risky strategies that enhance fitness on average but which have detrimental consequences for a subset of individuals. Second, mismatch may result when organisms experience environmental change during ontogeny, for instance, because they move from one environment to another. Third, organisms may learn about their environment in order to develop an appropriate phenotype; when cues indicate the environmental state probabilistically, as opposed to deterministically, sampling processes may produce mismatch. For each source of maladaptation, we present a selection of the relevant empirical research and illustrate how models from evolutionary biology can be used to make predictions about maladaptation. We also discuss what data can be collected to test these models in humans. Our goal is to show that evolutionary approaches not only yield insights into adaptive outcomes but can also illuminate the conditions leading to maladaptation. This perspective provides additional nuance to the dialectic between the developmental psychopathology model and evolutionary developmental psychology.},

In the present article, I draw recent empirical evidence together to support the continued value of computing and seeking to elevate positivity ratios. I also underscore the necessity of modeling nonlinear effects of positivity ratios and, more generally, the value of systems science approaches within affective science and positive psychology. Even when scrubbed of Losada‚Äôs now-questioned mathematical modeling, ample evidence continues to support the conclusion that, within bounds, higher positivity ratios are predictive of Ô¨Çourishing mental health and other beneÔ¨Åcial outcomes.},

Results showed that this meditation practice produced increases over time in daily experiences of positive emotions, which, in turn, produced increases in a wide range of personal resources (e.g., increased mindfulness, purpose in life, social support, decreased illness symptoms). In turn, these increments in personal resources predicted increased life satisfaction and reduced depressive symptoms. Discussion centers on how positive emotions are the mechanism of change for the type of mind-training practice studied here and how loving-kindness meditation is an intervention strategy that produces positive emotions in a way that outpaces the hedonic treadmill effect.},

Cognitive bias modiÔ¨Åcation of interpretations (CBM-I) training has emerged as a targeted intervention for early emerging anxiety problems.

Here, we assessed training efÔ¨Åcacy in ameliorating interpretation biases and anxious mood in adolescents with anxiety disorders. Twenty-eight Chinese adolescents meeting criteria for a current anxiety disorder were randomly assigned to receive positive or neutral CBM-I training. Training involved completing a word-fragment to resolve the outcomes of sixty ambiguous scenarios. During positive training, scenarios ended with benign/positive resolutions, but during neutral training, half of the scenarios were resolved positively and half negatively. Positively trained patients interpreted new ambiguous scenarios less negatively than the neutral training group although training effects were not observed on a questionnaire measure of interpretation bias. Training effects on mood were also absent. Before the clinical implications of CBM-I can be considered in adolescents, research needs to establish optimal training parameters for symptom-changes to occur.},

The etiology of these trajectories is still unclear. Individual differences in levels of negative and positive emotion are believed to play a role in determining risk and resilience following traumatic exposure. In the current investigation, we followed police officers prospectively from academy training through 48 months of active duty, assessing levels of distress every 12 months. Using latent class growth analysis, we identified 4 trajectories closely conforming to prototypical patterns. Furthermore, we found that lower levels of self-reported negative emotion during academy training prospectively predicted membership in the resilient trajectory compared with the more symptomatic trajectories following the initiation of active duty, whereas higher levels of positive emotion during academy training differentiated resilience from a trajectory that was equivalently low on distress during academy training but consistently grew in distress through 4 years of active duty. These findings emerging from a prospective longitudinal design provide evidence that resilience is predicted by both lower levels of negative emotion and higher levels of positive emotion prior to active duty stressor exposure.},

	abstract = {Heterogeneity in glucocorticoid response to experimental stress conditions has shown to differentiate individuals with healthy from maladaptive real-life stress responses in a number of distinct domains. However, it is not known if this heterogeneity inÔ¨Çuences the risk for developing stress related disorders or if it is a biological consequence of the stress response itself. Determining if glucocorticoid response to stress induction prospectively predicts psychological vulnerability to signiÔ¨Åcant real life stressors can adjudicate this issue. To test this relationship, salivary cortisol as well as catecholamine responses to a laboratory stressor during academy training were examined as predictors of empirically identiÔ¨Åed distress trajectories through the subsequent 4 years of active duty among urban police ofÔ¨Åcers routinely exposed to potentially traumatic events and routine life stressors (N ¬º 234). During training, ofÔ¨Åcers were exposed to a video vignette of police ofÔ¨Åcers exposed to real-life trauma. Changes in salivary 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) and cortisol in response to this video challenge were examined as predictors of trajectory membership while controlling for age, gender, and baseline neuroendocrine levels. OfÔ¨Åcers who followed trajectories of resilience and recovery over 4 years mounted signiÔ¨Åcant increases in cortisol in response to the experimental stressor, while those following a trajectory of chronic increasing distress had no signiÔ¨Åcant cortisol change in response to the challenge. MHPG responses were not associated with distress trajectories. Cortisol response prospectively differentiated trajectories of distress response suggesting that a blunted cortisol response to a laboratory stressor is a risk factor for later vulnerability to distress following signiÔ¨Åcant life stressors.},

Results indicated that Global SWB is predicted by Satisfaction with Life in Domains, and Positive and Negative State Affect.

The affective dimension of SWB is predicted by Trait Affect, Depression, Anxiety, and the contextual variable of educational status.

Next, by explicating the processes through which momentary experiences of emotions may accrue into self-perpetuating emotional systems, the current review proposes an underlying architecture of state-trait interactions that engenders lasting affective dispositions. This theoretical framework is then used to elucidate the cognitive‚Äìemotional mechanisms underpinning three disorders of affect regulation: depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia. In turn, two mind training interventions, mindfulness and loving-kindness meditation, are highlighted as means of generating positive emotions that may counter the negative affective processes implicated in these disorders. We conclude with the proposition that positive emotions may exert a countervailing force on the dysphoric, fearful, or anhedonic states characteristic of psychopathologies typiÔ¨Åed by emotional dysfunctions.},

	abstract = {Adolescence is a developmental period characterized by elevated stress, heightened risky behaviors, and increases in psychopathology. Emotion dysregulation is a hypothesized contributor to negative outcomes and to the onset of psychopathology during adolescence. However, the dysregulation of negative emotion has been the focus of research while the literature on positive emotion in adolescent psychopathology is limited. This review highlights both the development of normative and dysregulated positive emotion during adolescence. First, the literature on normative adolescent emotional development and on negative emotional regulation is brieÔ¨Çy reviewed, followed by a discussion of current theories of positive emotion, which are grounded in the adult literature. From a developmental perspective, the dimension of approach motivation within positive emotion is emphasized throughout and frames the review. This conceptualization guides organization of literatures on normative experiences of positive emotion in adolescence and the role of dysregulated positive emotion in adolescent psychopathology, speciÔ¨Åcally adolescent depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, externalizing disorders and eating disorders. Last, future directions in the study of adolescent positive emotion and its regulation and the implications of highlighting approach motivation in normative and dysregulated positive emotion in adolescence are detailed.},

Regression analyses tested whether positive affect predicted successful and unsuccessful adaptation to stress (viz., resilience and burnout, respectively) after controlling for demographic characteristics and work stress. Positive affect was largely correlated with resilience (r = .65, p {\textbackslash}textbackslash .001) and burnout (r = -.57, p {\textbackslash}textbackslash .001). The regression of resilience showed that positive affect had a direct effect (b = .66, p {\textbackslash}textbackslash .001) and the total model explained 44 \% of the variance (R2 Change = 37 \%). In the regression of burnout, positive affect also had a direct effect (b = -.41, p {\textbackslash}textbackslash .001) and the total model explained 52 \% of the variance (R2 Change = 14 \%). Further analyses found no signiÔ¨Åcant interaction between work stress and positive affect, but revealed that positive affect completely mediated the effect of work stress on resilience. Results provide support for the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions, particularly the theory‚Äôs building and undoing effects.},

	abstract = {The broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions suggests that positive emotions can widen the range of potential coping strategies that come to mind and subsequently enhance one‚Äôs resilience against stress. Studies have shown that high stress, especially chronic levels of stress, strongly contributes to the development of anxiety and depressive symptoms. However, researchers have also found that individuals who possess high levels of resilience are protected from stress and thus report lower levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Using a sample of 200 postdoctoral research fellows, the present study examined if (a) positive emotions were associated with greater resilience, (b) coping strategies mediated the link between positive emotions and resilience and (c) resilience moderated the inÔ¨Çuence of stress on trait anxiety and depressive symptoms. Results support the broaden-and-build theory in that positive emotions may enhance resilience directly as well as indirectly through the mediating role of coping strategies‚Äîparticularly via adaptive coping. Resilience also moderated the association of stress with trait anxiety and depressive symptoms. Although stress is unavoidable and its inÔ¨Çuences on anxiety and depressive symptoms are undeniable, the likelihood of postdocs developing anxiety or depressive symptoms may be reduced by implementing programmes designed to increase positive emotions, adaptive coping strategies and resilience.

Because it has been suggested that these changes could be related to the processing of emotional information, the aim of this study was to investigate interference and inhibition towards sad and happy faces in healthy elderly people compared to a younger population. Method: We used an affective modification of the negative priming task. If interference is related to enhanced inhibition, reduced interference from negative stimuli and a related weakened inhibition towards negative stimuli in the elderly group would be in line with the positivity hypothesis. Results: As expected, the results indicated that interference from negative stimuli was significantly lower in older adults as compared to younger adults, whereas this was not the case for positive stimuli. Moreover, at inhibitory level a significantly reduced processing of negative stimuli was observed only in the older adult group, whereas there was no such effect in the case of positive material.},

The present study sought to explore the concept of ‚Äòflourishing‚Äô as it is constructed by students in British HE. An open-ended questionnaire was distributed to 222 students across two post-1992 (former polytechnic) British universities to elicit written qualitative data on their understandings of ‚Äòflourishing‚Äô and ‚Äòflourishing at university‚Äô, and of their characterisations of ‚Äòflourishing‚Äô and ‚Äònon-flourishing‚Äô students. Data was content analysed using an inductive approach. Prominent categories emerging from the data sets constructed ‚Äòflourishing‚Äô primarily as self-actualisation (personal growth, potential realisation) and success. However, engagement (both academic and social) emerged as a significant facet of ‚Äòflourishing at university‚Äô. The ‚Äòflourishing student‚Äô was characterised as academically and socially engaged, committed to learning, and oriented towards personal growth. Conversely, the ‚Äònon-flourishing‚Äô student emerged as having a general sense of lacking, a disengaged attitude towards academic work, and a lazy/withdrawn outlook. Results provide inductively derived support for four components of Wellbeing Theory ‚Äì positive emotions, engagement, relationships, and achievement (Seligman, 2011) and allow generic understandings of ‚Äòflourishing‚Äô to be contextualised within a HE setting. Further implications of the study and suggestions for future research are discussed with regard to the findings.},

	abstract = {Cognitive theories of depression posit that people‚Äôs thoughts, inferences, attitudes, and interpretations, and the way in which they attend to and recall information, can increase their risk for depression. Three mechanisms have been implicated in the relation between biased cognitive processing and the dysregulation of emotion in depression: inhibitory processes and deÔ¨Åcits in working memory, ruminative responses to negative mood states and negative life events, and the inability to use positive and rewarding stimuli to regulate negative mood. In this review, we present a contemporary characterization of depressive cognition and discuss how different cognitive processes are related not only to each other, but also to emotion dysregulation, the hallmark feature of depression. We conclude that depression is characterized by increased elaboration of negative information, by difÔ¨Åculties disengaging from negative material, and by deÔ¨Åcits in cognitive control when processing negative information. We discuss treatment implications of these conclusions and argue that the study of cognitive aspects of depression must be broadened by investigating neural and genetic factors that are related to cognitive dysfunction in this disorder. Such integrative investigations should help us gain a more comprehensive understanding of how cognitive and biological factors interact to affect the onset, maintenance, and course of depression.},

	abstract = {In recent years there has been growing interest in determining the attentional basis of positive affectivity. Investigators have sought to evaluate the hypothesis that elevated positive affectivity is characterized by an attentional bias that favours the processing of positive information over neutral information. Unfortunately, in the studies carried out to date, the assessment procedures used by researchers to assess such attentional selectivity have either been methodologically limited or methodologically Ô¨Çawed. Hence, the validity of the hypothesis has remained indeterminate. To overcome the problems associated with attentional assessment procedures used in previous studies, and so shed light on the attentional basis of positive affectivity, we employed an appropriate variant of the attentional probe task. Our Ô¨Åndings show that participants high in positive affectivity displayed greater relative attention to positive information compared to neutral information, than was the case for their low positive affectivity counterparts. Thus, the present results support the hypothesis that an attentional bias to positive information, relative to neutral information, is characteristic of elevated positive affectivity.},

While this has invited speculation that differential attentional responding to positive information may directly contribute to the determination of this emotional temperament, the causal basis of their association as yet remains unknown. We addressed this issue by experimentally manipulating selective attentional response to positive information, using a cognitive bias modiÔ¨Åcation variant of the attentional probe task, and examining the impact of this attentional manipulation on positive emotional reactivity to a subsequent success experience. The Ô¨Åndings support the hypothesis that individual differences in selective attentional response to positive information can make a causal contribution to variation in positive affectivity.

Given that reliabilities vary as a function of the design of these tasks and the characteristics of the individuals taking them, making inferences about the reliability of scores in an ongoing study based on reliability estimates from prior studies is precarious. Thus, it would be advantageous to estimate reliability based on data from the ongoing study. We argue that internal consistency estimates of reliability are underutilized for experimental task data and in many applications could provide this information using a single administration of a task. We discuss different methods for computing internal consistency estimates with a generalized coefficient alpha and the conditions under which these estimates are accurate. We illustrate use of these coefficients using data for three different tasks.},

Therefore, the aim of this study was to further investigate the attentional broadening effects of positive emotions, testing whether this is inÔ¨Çuenced by the emotional valence of the information presented and secondly, how the presence of depressive symptoms might interact with this relationship. We used a performance-based measure to assess Ô¨Çuctuations in attentional broadening for positive, neutral, and negative stimuli. We assessed the presence and severity of depressive symptoms in an unselected study sample and tested whether these symptoms moderate the relationship between induced positive mood and attentional breadth for emotional information. Results showed no direct relation between positive mood and attentional breadth, regardless of the emotional valence of the stimuli. However, the presence of depressive symptoms moderated this relationship in such a way that among low levels of depressive symptoms, positive mood was related to attentional broadening speciÔ¨Åcally when positive information was presented, while at high levels of depressive symptoms this relation was reversed. The current Ô¨Åndings suggest that both stimuli characteristics, individual characteristics and their interplay should be taken into account when investigating the broadening effects of positive emotions.},

	abstract = {Recent efforts have been made to understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying psychological resilience. Cognitive flexibility in the context of affective information has been related to individual differences in resilience. However, it is unclear whether flexible affective processing is sensitive to mood fluctuations. Furthermore, it remains to be investigated how effects on flexible affective processing interact with the affective valence of information that is presented. To fill this gap, we tested the effects of positive mood and individual differences in self-reported resilience on affective flexibility, using a task switching paradigm (N œ≠ 80). The main findings showed that positive mood was related to lower task switching costs, reflecting increased flexibility, in line with previous findings. In line with this effect of positive mood, we showed that greater resilience levels, specifically levels of acceptance of self and life, also facilitated task set switching in the context of affective information. However, the effects of resilience on affective flexibility seem more complex. Resilience tended to relate to more efficient task switching when negative information was preceded by positive information, possibly because the presentation of positive information, as well as positive mood, can facilitate task set switching. Positive mood also influenced costs associated with switching affective valence of the presented information. This latter effect was indicative of a reduced impact of no longer relevant negative information and more impact of no longer relevant positive information. Future research should confirm these effects of individual differences in resilience on affective flexibility, considering the affective valence of the presented information.},

Given the widely investigated relationship between self-focused attention and mood, it is important to investigate the effect of positive mood on visuospatial attention for self-related information. We used a performance-based measure to assess Ô¨Çuctuations in attentional broadening from self-related contrasted to not-self-related information.

While recent randomized control trials (RCTs) suggest that ABMT reduces anxiety, therapeutic effects have not been summarized quantitatively. Methods‚ÄîStandard meta-analytic procedures were used to summarize the effect of ABMT on anxiety. Using MEDLINE, January 1995 to February 2010, we identified RCTs comparing the effects on anxiety of ABMT and quantified effect sizes using Hedge‚Äôs d. Results‚ÄîTwelve studies met inclusion criteria, including 467 participants from 10 publications. ABMT produced significantly greater reductions in anxiety than control training, with a medium effect (d = 0.61, p {\textbackslash}textless.001). Age and gender did not moderate the effect of ABMT on anxiety, while several characteristics of the ABMT training did. Conclusions‚ÄîABMT shows promise as a novel treatment for anxiety. Additional RCTs are needed to fully evaluate the degree to which these findings replicate and apply to patients. Future work should consider the precise role for ABMT in the broader anxiety-disorder therapeutic armamentarium.},

	abstract = {Cognitive biases have been theorized to play a critical role in the onset and maintenance of anxiety and depression. Cognitive bias modification (CBM), an experimental paradigm that uses training to induce maladaptive or adaptive cognitive biases, was developed to test these causal models. Although CBM has generated considerable interest in the past decade, both as an experimental paradigm and as a form of treatment, there have been no quantitative reviews of the effect of CBM on anxiety and depression. This meta-analysis of 45 studies (2,591 participants) assessed the effect of CBM on cognitive biases and on anxiety and depression. CBM had a medium effect on biases (g œ≠ 0.49) that was stronger for interpretation (g œ≠ 0.81) than for attention (g œ≠ 0.29) biases. CBM further had a small effect on anxiety and depression (g œ≠ 0.13), although this effect was reliable only when symptoms were assessed after participants experienced a stressor (g œ≠ 0.23). When anxiety and depression were examined separately, CBM significantly modified anxiety but not depression. There was a nonsignificant trend toward a larger effect for studies including multiple training sessions. These findings are broadly consistent with cognitive theories of anxiety and depression that propose an interactive effect of cognitive biases and stressors on these symptoms. However, the small effect sizes observed here suggest that this effect may be more modest than previously believed.},

Rumination was assessed at baseline in a sample of early and middle adolescents (N = 350, 6‚Äì10th graders). Symptom measures of depression, anxious arousal, general internalizing, and conduct/externalizing problems with good discriminant validity were assessed at four time points over a 5-month period. Results using hierarchical linear modeling show that rumination predicted prospective fluctuations in symptoms of depression and general internalizing problems specifically but not anxious arousal or externalizing problems. Rumination predicted increasing prospective trajectories of general internalizing symptoms. Baseline rumination interacted with prospective cooccurring fluctuations of anxious arousal and externalizing behaviors over time to predict the highest levels of prospective depressive symptoms.

The mechanisms mediating these relations, however, are poorly understood. We examined the relation between exposure to ELS and reward-related brain activity, which is known to predict motivation and mood, at age 26, in a sample followed since kindergarten with annual assessments. Using functional neuroimaging, we assayed individual differences in the activity of the ventral striatum (VS) during the processing of monetary rewards associated with a simple card-guessing task, in a sample of 72 male participants. We examined associations between a cumulative measure of ELS exposure and VS activity in adulthood. We found that greater levels of cumulative stress during childhood and adolescence predicted lower reward-related VS activity in adulthood. Extending this general developmental pattern, we found that exposure to stress early in development (between kindergarten and grade 3) was significantly associated with variability in adult VS activity. Our results provide an important demonstration that cumulative life stress, especially during this childhood period, is associated with blunted reward-related VS activity in adulthood. These differences suggest neurobiological pathways through which a history of ELS may contribute to reduced motivation and increased negative mood.},

This early positive-biasing of emotional processing could help explain why antidepressant drug treatments have a delayed clinical onset of action, but suggest that the delay may occur because of the need for further psychological rather than neurophysiological processing. The identification of these early effects suggest that we need to look earlier on in the treatment cascade to begin to understand the complex effects of these drugs and that understanding both cognitive and pharmacological effects of treatments may be an important avenue for future study.},

Recent studies in animal models suggest that the degree to which one is able to control an aversive experience is a critical factor determining its behavioral consequences. In this study, we examined whether stressor controllability modulates subsequent conditioned fear expression in humans. Participants were randomly assigned to an escapable stressor condition, a yoked inescapable stressor condition, or a control condition involving no stress exposure. One week later, all participants underwent fear conditioning, fear extinction, and a test of extinction retrieval the following day. Participants exposed to inescapable stress showed impaired fear extinction learning and increased fear expression the following day. In contrast, escapable stress improved fear extinction and prevented the spontaneous recovery of fear. Consistent with the bidirectional controllability effects previously reported in animal models, these results suggest that one‚Äôs degree of control over aversive experiences may be an important factor inÔ¨Çuencing the development of psychological resilience or vulnerability in humans.},

	abstract = {Traumatic events are proposed to play a role in the development of anxiety disorders, however not all individuals exposed to extreme stress experience a pathological increase in fear. Recent studies in animal models suggest that the degree to which one is able to control an aversive experience is a critical factor determining its behavioral consequences. In this study, we examined whether stressor controllability modulates subsequent conditioned fear expression in humans. Participants were randomly assigned to an escapable stressor condition, a yoked inescapable stressor condition, or a control condition involving no stress exposure. One week later, all participants underwent fear conditioning, fear extinction, and a test of extinction retrieval the following day. Participants exposed to inescapable stress showed impaired fear extinction learning and increased fear expression the following day. In contrast, escapable stress improved fear extinction and prevented the spontaneous recovery of fear. Consistent with the bidirectional controllability effects previously reported in animal models, these results suggest that one‚Äôs degree of control over aversive experiences may be an important factor inÔ¨Çuencing the development of psychological resilience or vulnerability in humans.},

Specifically, we investigated the relationship between pain catastrophizing and attention bias to pain facial expressions. Furthermore, drawing on dual process models in the context of pain, we investigated the moderating role of attention control on this relationship. Adolescents (N 5 73; age, 16-18 years) performed a dot-probe task in which facial expressions of pain and neutral expressions were presented for 100 milliseconds and 1250 milliseconds. Participants also completed self-report pain catastrophizing and attention control measures. We found that although there was no main effect of pain catastrophizing on attention bias towards pain faces, attention control did significantly moderate this relationship. Further analysis revealed that lower levels of attention control were significantly associated with increasing attentional vigilance towards pain faces only within high catastrophizing adolescents. In addition, we found that poorer attention control was related to increased attention bias for pain faces (regardless of pain catastrophizing level) when these faces were presented for relatively longer durations (ie, 1250 milliseconds) but not for short durations (ie, 100 milliseconds). This study supports a dual process model of attentional processes in pain, thus replicating previous findings within the psychopathology literature but extending them to the study of pain. Theoretical and clinical implications of our findings are discussed.},

	abstract = {Cognitive models posit that social anxiety disorder (SAD) is associated with and maintained by biased attention allocation vis-√†-vis social threat. However, over the last decade, there has been intense debate regarding whether AB in SAD results from preferential engagement with or difÔ¨Åculty in disengaging from social threat. Further, recent evidence suggests that AB may merely result from top-down attentional impairments vis-√†-vis non-emotional material. Consequently, uncertainty still abounds regarding both the relative importance and the mutual interactions of these different processes and SAD symptoms. Inspired by novel network approaches to psychopathology that conceptualize symptoms as complex dynamic systems of mutually interacting variables, we computed weighted directed networks to investigate potential causal relations among laboratory measures of attentional components and symptoms of social anxiety disorder. Global and local connectivity of network structures revealed that the three most central variables were the orienting component of attention as well as both avoidance and fear of social situations. Neither preferential attention engagement with threat nor difÔ¨Åculty disengaging from threat exhibited high relative importance as predictors of symptoms in the network. Together, these Ô¨Åndings suggest the value of extending the network approach beyond self-reported clinical symptoms to incorporate process-level measures from laboratory tasks to gain new insight into the mechanisms of SAD.},

A systematic search in bibliographical databases uncovered 15 randomized studies involving 1043 individuals that compared ABM to a control training procedure. Data were extracted independently by two raters. The Q statistic was used to assess homogeneity across trials. All analyses were conducted on intent-totreat data. ABM produced a small but signiÔ¨Åcant reduction in SAD symptoms (g = 0.27), reactivity to speech challenge (g = 0.46), and AB (g = 0.30). These effects were moderated by characteristics of the ABM procedure, the design of the study, and trait anxiety at baseline. However, effects on secondary symptoms (g = 0.09) and SAD symptoms at 4-month follow-up (g = 0.09) were not signiÔ¨Åcant. Although there was no indication of signiÔ¨Åcant publication bias, the quality of the studies was substandard and wedged the effect sizes. From a clinical point of view, these Ô¨Åndings imply that ABM is not yet ready for wide-scale dissemination as a treatment for SAD in routine care.

	abstract = {Recently, the disagreement that separates hedonic from eudaimonic philosophers has spread to the science of wellbeing. This has resulted in two opposing perspectives regarding both wellbeing concepts and proposed pathways to wellbeing. Whilst contention continues, most contemporary psychologists now agree that hedonic and eudaimonic approaches each denote important aspects of wellbeing. This has led to integrated wellbeing conceptualisations, in which the combined presence of hedonic and eudaimonic wellbeing components is referred to as ‚Äòflourishing‚Äô. In regard to the attainment of wellbeing, research simultaneously investigating hedonic and eudaimonic pathways suggests that a life rich in both types of pursuits is associated with the highest degree of wellbeing. Despite this assertion, previously underemphasised methodological limitations question the validity of such claims. To further progress this important area of investigation, future research directions to ameliorate said limitations are explored. It is recommended that the past tendency to contrast and compare hedonia and eudaimonia be abandoned, and instead that the inherent value of both be recognised. Time-use research methods are needed to cross-validate past findings obtained from cross-sectional research, which will make it possible to transition from purely descriptive conclusions to applied conclusions.},

To provide normative data for the general adult population. Design. Cross-sectional, correlational and conÔ¨Årmatory factor analysis (CFA). Methods. The DASS-21 was administered to a non-clinical sample, broadly representative of the general adult UK population (N ¬º 1; 794). Competing models of the latent structure of the DASS-21 were evaluated using CFA. Results. The model with optimal Ô¨Åt (RCFI ¬º 0.94) had a quadripartite structure, and consisted of a general factor of psychological distress plus orthogonal speciÔ¨Åc factors of depression, anxiety, and stress. This model was a signiÔ¨Åcantly better Ô¨Åt than a competing model that tested the possibility that the Stress scale simply measures NA. Conclusions. The DASS-21 subscales can validly be used to measure the dimensions of depression, anxiety, and stress. However, each of these subscales also taps a more general dimension of psychological distress or NA. The utility of the measure is enhanced by the provision of normative data based on a large sample.},

The review demonstrated consistent support for a relationship with trauma exposure and depression symptoms in childhood. Furthermore, OGM was found to predict depression symptoms. Limited support was provided for the efÔ¨Åcacy of the CaR-FA-X model in young people. Conclusions. Future research will need to examine the inÔ¨Çuence of trauma characteristics on OGM development, along with the relationship of OGM to depression prognosis. Further investigation of the CaR-FA-X model is required and developmental aspects will need to be taken into account.},

	abstract = {Current concepts of the neurobiology of stress-related disorders, such as anxiety and depression emphasize disruptions in neural plasticity and neurotrophins.The potent trophic actions of exercise, therefore, represent not only an effective means for prevention and treatment of these disorders, they also afford the opportunity to employ exercise paradigms as a basic research tool to uncover the neurobiological mechanisms underlying these disorders. Novel approaches to studying stress-related disorders focus increasingly on trophic factor signaling in corticolimbic circuits that both mediate and regulate cognitive, behavioral, and physiological responses to deleterious stress. Recent evidence demonstrates that the neural plasticity supported by these trophic mechanisms is vital for establishing and maintaining resilience to stress. Therapeutic interventions that promote these mechanisms, be they pharmacological, behavioral, or environmental, may therefore prevent or reverse stress-related mental illness by enhancing resilience. The present paper will provide an overview of trophic mechanisms responsible for the enhancement of resilience by voluntary exercise with an emphasis on brain-derived neurotrophic factor, galanin, and interactions between these two trophic factors.},

	abstract = {The epidemiology of flourishing is an important research topic prompting international interest in its psychometric assessment. But the need to measure human feelings and functioning at the population level has resulted in the creation of a multitude of different conceptual frameworks of flourishing: a term now commonly used to describe high levels of subjective wellbeing. Not only do different researchers theorise and conceptualise flourishing in different ways, but also the categorical diagnosis of flourishing is dependent upon the various combinations of components, and researcher-determined thresholds, used in each operationalization. The multiplicity of approaches is potentially limiting the usefulness of the resultant epidemiology. This paper comprises two parts: Part 1 identifies four operationalizations of flourishing in the psychology literature and reviews their psychometric properties and utility; Part 2 investigates the impact of operational definition on the prevalence of flourishing using the Sovereign Wellbeing Index survey, a sample of 10,009 adult New Zealanders, and reports substantial variation in prevalence rates according to the four different operationalizations: Huppert and So (24\%), Keyes (39\%), Diener et al. (41\%) and Seligman et al. (47\%). Huppert and So‚Äôs model was the only one of the four to require endorsement of one particular variable, making it the most stringent criterion for flourishing, while the other three were more flexible in their categorisation. Cross-tabulation analysis indicated strong agreement between our replications of Keyes and Seligman et al.‚Äôs models (81\%), and between Diener et al. and Seligman et al.‚Äôs models (80\%). Agreement between Seligman, and Huppert and So‚Äôs, operationalizations was moderate (74\%). Taken together, and in line with recent OECD recommendations, our findings reinforce the need for greater international collaboration and conceptualisation consensus when measuring flourishing. In the absence of any published empirical research investigating perceptions of flourishing among laypersons, a prototype analysis investigating alignment between lay and academic conceptualisations of flourishing is recommended.},

Literature suggests that cognitive control training (CCT) targeting working memory functioning can increase effectiveness of existing antidepressant treatments to reduce rumination. However, it remains unclear whether CCT can also be implemented as a preventive intervention for depression, increasing resilience. For this purpose, at-risk undergraduate students (high trait ruminators) were allocated to a CCT or active control condition, consisting of 10 online training sessions. Working memory functioning was assessed preceding and following the training and reactivity to a lab stressor was assessed directly following training. Finally, at four weeks follow-up, brooding e the maladaptive form of rumination e was re-assessed in response to a naturalistic stressor (examination period). Although we did not Ô¨Ånd direct transfer effects of CCT on working memory functioning, increase in working memory functioning following CCT was related to post-training brooding and resilience levels. Moreover, participants receiving CCT demonstrated lower stress reactivity in the lab and a decrease in brooding following a naturalistic stressor at follow-up, indicating temporal stability of our Ô¨Åndings. These Ô¨Åndings suggest that CCT can be considered a promising preventive intervention to reduce stress reactivity and rumination.},

	abstract = {Background: Individuals in remission from depression are at increased risk for developing future depressive episodes. Several cognitive risk- and resilience factors have been suggested to account for this vulnerability. In the current study we explored how risk- and protective factors such as cognitive control, adaptive and maladaptive emotion regulation, residual symptomatology, and resilience relate to one another in a remitted depressed (RMD) sample. Methods: We examined the relationships between these constructs in a cross-sectional dataset of 69 RMD patients using network analyses in order to obtain a comprehensive, data-driven view on the interplay between these constructs. We subsequently present an association network, a concentration network, and a relative importance network. Results: In all three networks resilience formed the central hub, connecting perceived cognitive control (i.e., working memory complaints), emotion regulation, and residual symptomatology. The contribution of the behavioral measure for cognitive control in the network was negligible. Moreover, the directed relative importance network indicates bidirectional inÔ¨Çuences between these constructs, with all indicators of centrality suggesting a key role of resilience in remission from depression. Limitations: The presented Ô¨Åndings are cross-sectional and networks are limited to a Ô¨Åxed set of key constructs in the literature pertaining cognitive vulnerability for depression. Conclusions: These Ô¨Åndings indicate the importance of resilience to successfully cope with stressors following remission from depression. Further in-depth studies will be essential to identify the speciÔ¨Åc underlying resilience mechanisms that may be key to successful remission from depression.},

	abstract = {Governments around the world are recognising the importance of measuring subjective well-being as an indicator of progress. But how should well-being be measured? A conceptual framework is offered which equates high well-being with positive mental health. Well-being is seen as lying at the opposite end of a spectrum to the common mental disorders (depression, anxiety). By examining internationally agreed criteria for depression and anxiety (DSM and ICD classiÔ¨Åcations), and deÔ¨Åning the opposite of each symptom, we identify ten features of positive well-being. These combine feeling and functioning, i.e. hedonic and eudaimonic aspects of well-being: competence, emotional stability, engagement, meaning, optimism, positive emotion, positive relationships, resilience, self esteem, and vitality. An operational deÔ¨Ånition of Ô¨Çourishing is developed, based on psychometric analysis of indicators of these ten features, using data from a representative sample of 43,000 Europeans. Application of this deÔ¨Ånition to respondents from the 23 countries which participated in the European Social Survey (Round 3) reveals a four-fold difference in Ô¨Çourishing rate, from 41\% in Denmark to less than 10\% in Slovakia, Russia and Portugal. There are also striking differences in country proÔ¨Åles across the 10 features. These proÔ¨Åles offer fresh insight into cultural differences in well-being, and indicate which features may provide the most promising targets for policies to improve well-being. Comparison with a life satisfaction measure shows that valuable information would be lost if well-being was measured by life satisfaction. Taken together, our Ô¨Åndings reinforce the need to measure subjective well-being as a multi-dimensional construct in future surveys.},

In multiple regression, strengths usually related more to positive well-being‚Äîlife satisfaction, positive affect, vitality, meaning, elevating experience‚Äîthough vulnerabilities also related to the Ô¨Årst three variables; vulnerabilities related more to illbeing‚Äînegative affect, depression‚Äîthough hope, humor, enthusiasm, and forgiveness sometimes also showed relationships. Pre-treatment strengths (hope, spirituality, appreciation of beauty and excellence) predicted post-treatment recovery from depression; cognitive vulnerabilities did not. Strengths and vulnerabilities sometimes interacted, with strengths weakening the relationship between vulnerabilities and well-being. Our Ô¨Åndings indicate that strengths and vulnerabilities are not mere opposites (correlating at most moderately) and deserve study as distinct contributors to well-being.},

We conducted four studies (two correlational, one experience-sampling, and one intervention study) to determine outcomes associated with activities motivated by hedonic and eudaimonic aims. Overall, results indicated that: between persons (at the trait level) and within persons (at the momentary state level), hedonic pursuits related more to positive affect and carefreeness, while eudaimonic pursuits related more to meaning; between persons, eudaimonia related more to elevating experience (awe, inspiration, and sense of connection with a greater whole); within persons, hedonia related more negatively to negative affect; between and within persons, both pursuits related equally to vitality; and both pursuits showed some links with life satisfaction, though hedonia‚Äôs links were more frequent. People whose lives were high in both eudaimonia and hedonia had: higher degrees of most well-being variables than people whose lives were low in both pursuits (but did not differ in negative affect or carefreeness); higher positive affect and carefreeness than predominantly eudaimonic individuals; and higher meaning, elevating experience, and vitality than predominantly hedonic individuals. In the intervention study, hedonia produced more well-being beneÔ¨Åts at short-term follow-up, while eudaimonia produced more at 3-month follow-up.

	abstract = {Evolutionary-biological reasoning suggests that individuals should be differentially susceptible to environmental influences, with some people being not just more vulnerable than others to the negative effects of adversity, as the prevailing diathesis-stress view of psychopathology (and of many environmental influences) maintains, but also disproportionately susceptible to the beneficial effects of supportive and enriching experiences (or just the absence of adversity). Evidence consistent with the proposition that individuals differ in plasticity is reviewed. The authors document multiple instances in which (a) phenotypic temperamental characteristics, (b) endophenotypic attributes, and (c) specific genes function less like ‚Äúvulnerability factors‚Äù and more like ‚Äúplasticity factors,‚Äù thereby rendering some individuals more malleable or susceptible than others to both negative and positive environmental influences. Discussion focuses upon limits of the evidence, statistical criteria for distinguishing differential susceptibility from diathesis stress, potential mechanisms of influence, and unknowns in the differentialsusceptibility equation.},

Little research has examined the psychometric properties of the VPT, despite concerns it demonstrates poor test‚Äìretest reliability and internal consistency. These issues can reduce confidence in inferences based on VPT performance. As such, we attempted to identify parameters under which the reliability of the alcohol VPT might be improved by applying recent empirical recommendations for outlier handling, bias calculation, and task design from the anxiety literature. We reanalyzed data from 3 previously published studies in our laboratory and 2 newly collected data sets. We compared tasks which presented images on the left/right of the screen to above/below, whether participants responded to the location or content of the probe, and whether general alcohol-related images or images personalized to the individual were used. In each VPT we also applied a priori outlier removal (2 and 3 standard deviations and median absolute difference) and data-driven outlier removal (winsorizing), in addition to calculating trial-level bias scores. Across all studies and tasks internal consistency and test‚Äìretest reliability of attentional bias measures were inadequate. There was no consistent improvement in internal consistency or test‚Äìretest reliability as a function of outlier removal methods. We were unable to demonstrate adequate reliability of the alcohol VPT, which further supports observations that these tasks may not yield reliable measures. Future research should focus on improving the reliability of these tasks or abandoning them in favor of more reliable alternatives.},

	abstract = {Background: When switching from one task to a new one, reaction times are prolonged. This phenomenon is called switch cost (SC). Researchers have recently used several kinds of task-switching paradigms to uncover neural mechanisms underlying the SC. Task-set reconfiguration and passive dissipation of a previously relevant task-set have been reported to contribute to the cost of task switching. Methodology/Principal Findings: An unpredictable cued task-switching paradigm was used, during which subjects were instructed to switch between a color and an orientation discrimination task. Electroencephalography (EEG) and behavioral measures were recorded in 14 subjects. Response-stimulus interval (RSI) and cue-stimulus interval (CSI) were manipulated with short and long intervals, respectively. Switch trials delayed reaction times (RTs) and increased error rates compared with repeat trials. The SC of RTs was smaller in the long CSI condition. For cue-locked waveforms, switch trials generated a larger parietal positive event-related potential (ERP), and a larger slow parietal positivity compared with repeat trials in the short and long CSI condition. Neural SC of cue-related ERP positivity was smaller in the long RSI condition. For stimuluslocked waveforms, a larger switch-related central negative ERP component was observed, and the neural SC of the ERP negativity was smaller in the long CSI. Results of standardized low resolution electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) for both ERP positivity and negativity showed that switch trials evoked larger activation than repeat trials in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Conclusions/Significance: The results provide evidence that both RSI and CSI modulate the neural activities in the process of task-switching, but that these have a differential role during task-set reconfiguration and passive dissipation of a previously relevant task-set.},

	abstract = {The well-replicated observation that many people maintain mental health despite exposure to severe psychological or physical adversity has ignited interest in the mechanisms that protect against stress-related mental illness. Focusing on resilience rather than pathophysiology in many ways represents a paradigm shift in clinical-psychological and psychiatric research that has great potential for the development of new prevention and treatment strategies. More recently, research into resilience also arrived in the neurobiological community, posing nontrivial questions about ecological validity and translatability. Drawing on concepts and Ô¨Åndings from transdiagnostic psychiatry, emotion research, and behavioral and cognitive neuroscience, we propose a uniÔ¨Åed theoretical framework for the neuroscientiÔ¨Åc study of general resilience mechanisms. The framework is applicable to both animal and human research and supports the design and interpretation of translational studies. The theory emphasizes the causal role of stimulus appraisal (evaluation) processes in the generation of emotional responses, including responses to potential stressors. On this basis, it posits that a positive (non-negative) appraisal style is the key mechanism that protects against the detrimental effects of stress and mediates the effects of other known resilience factors. Appraisal style is shaped by three classes of cognitive processes ‚Äì positive situation classiÔ¨Åcation, reappraisal, and interference inhibition ‚Äì that can be investigated at the neural level. Prospects for the future development of resilience research are discussed.},

These control functions are supported by the prefrontal cortex and therefore develop rapidly across childhood and mature well into late adolescence. Given that executive control is a strong predictor for various life outcomes, such as academic achievement, socioeconomic status, and physical health, numerous training interventions have been designed to improve executive functioning across the lifespan, many of them targeting children and adolescents. Despite the increasing popularity of these trainings, their results are neither robust nor consistent, and the transferability of training-induced performance improvements to untrained tasks seems to be limited. In this review, we provide a selective overview of the developmental literature on process-based cognitive interventions by discussing (1) the concept and the development of EFs and their neural underpinnings, (2) the effects of different types of executive control training in normally developing children and adolescents, (3) individual differences in training-related performance gains as well as (4) the potential of cognitive training interventions for the application in clinical and educational contexts. Based on recent Ô¨Åndings, we consider how transfer of process-based executive control trainings may be supported and how interventions may be tailored to the needs of speciÔ¨Åc age groups or populations.},

Without disputing their importance, these foci fail to capture many of the Ô¨Çuctuating, conÔ¨Çicting forces that are readily apparent when people navigate the environment and social world. In this paper, we review literature to offer evidence for the prominence of psychological Ô¨Çexibility in understanding psychological health. Thus far, the importance of psychological Ô¨Çexibility has been obscured by the isolation and disconnection of research conducted on this topic. Psychological Ô¨Çexibility spans a wide range of human abilities to: recognize and adapt to various situational demands; shift mindsets or behavioral repertoires when these strategies compromise personal or social functioning; maintain balance among important life domains; and be aware, open, and committed to behaviors that are congruent with deeply held values. In many forms of psychopathology, these Ô¨Çexibility processes are absent. In hopes of creating a more coherent understanding, we synthesize work in emotion regulation, mindfulness and acceptance, social and personality psychology, and neuropsychology. Basic research Ô¨Åndings provide insight into the nature, correlates, and consequences of psychological Ô¨Çexibility and applied research provides details on promising interventions. Throughout, we emphasize dynamic approaches that might capture this Ô¨Çuid construct in the real-world.},

	abstract = {Objective: This study sought to examine the relationship among the amount of stress, the perception that stress affects health, and health and mortality outcomes in a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. Methods: Data from the 1998 National Health Interview Survey were linked to prospective National Death Index mortality data through 2006. Separate logistic regression models were used to examine the factors associated with current health status and psychological distress. Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine the impact of perceiving that stress affects health on all-cause mortality. Each model specifically examined the interaction between the amount of stress and the perception that stress affects health, controlling for sociodemographic, health behavior, and access to health care factors. Results: 33.7\% of nearly 186 million (unweighted n œ≠ 28,753) U.S. adults perceived that stress affected their health a lot or to some extent. Both higher levels of reported stress and the perception that stress affects health were independently associated with an increased likelihood of worse health and mental health outcomes. The amount of stress and the perception that stress affects health interacted such that those who reported a lot of stress and that stress impacted their health a lot had a 43\% increased risk of premature death (HR œ≠ 1.43, 95\% CI [1.2, 1.7]). Conclusions: High amounts of stress and the perception that stress impacts health are each associated with poor health and mental health. Individuals who perceived that stress affects their health and reported a large amount of stress had an increased risk of premature death.},

Onethird of the total (72 \%) heritability of Ô¨Çourishing and 40 \% of its environmental variability are distinct from the big-Ô¨Åve personality traits. We also Ô¨Ånd a low phenotypic association (mean r = .22) between the three dimensions of SWB and big-Ô¨Åve personality traits despite substantial shared genetic etiology. In addition to non-trivial amounts of distinctive genetic and environmental variance and low phenotypic correlation, we point to limited investigation of reciprocal causation of SWB and personality.

We sought to describe the prevalence of mental health and illness, the stability of both diagnoses over time, and whether changes in mental health level predicted mental illness in a cohort group. Methods. In 2009, we analyzed data from the 1995 and 2005 Midlife in the United States cross-sectional surveys (n = 1723), which measured positive mental health and 12-month mental disorders of major depressive episode, panic, and generalized anxiety disorders. Results. Population prevalence of any of 3 mental disorders and levels of mental health appeared stable but were dynamic at the individual level. Fifty-two percent of the 17.5\% of respondents with any mental illness in 2005 were new cases; one half of those languishing in 1995 improved in 2005, and one half of those Ô¨Çourishing in 1995 declined in 2005. Change in mental health was strongly predictive of prevalence and incidence (operationalized as a new, not necessarily a Ô¨Årst, episode) of mental illness in 2005. Conclusions. Gains in mental health predicted declines in mental illness, supporting the call for public mental health promotion; losses of mental health predicted increases in mental illness, supporting the call for public mental health protection.

	abstract = {The past decade has witnessed an exponential growth in studies that have attempted to identify the genetic polymporphisms that moderate the influence of environmental risks on mental disorders. What tends to be neglected in these Gene√Ç Environment (G√Ç E) interaction studies has been a focus on resilience, which refers to a dynamic pattern of positive adaptation despite the experience of a significant trauma or adversity. In this article, we argue that one step toward advancing the field of developmental psychopathology would be for G √Ç E research to consider resilience instead of focusing almost exclusively on mental disorders. After providing an up-to-date summary on the expanding definitions and models of resilience, and the available evidence regarding measured G √Ç E studies of childhood maltreatment, we discuss why resilience would be a worthwhile phenotype for studies of measured G √Ç E. First, although G √Ç E hypotheses require that there be an environmental risk (e-risk) involved in a causal process that leads to psychopathology, e-risks are typically not included in the diagnostic criteria for most psychiatric disorders. In contrast, resilience by definition includes an e-risk. Second, G√ÇE hypotheses require that there is evidence of variability in response to an environmental stressor, and resilience often represents the positive end on this continuum of adaptation. Third, both resilience and G √Ç E are best understood from a developmental perspective. Fourth, although resilient outcomes are not public health concerns, the types of adversities (e.g., childhood maltreatment, poverty, or exposure to natural disasters) that are often investigated in studies of resilience certainly are. Understanding how some individuals, perhaps because of their genetic makeup, are able to withstand such adversities can inform prevention and intervention efforts to improve mental health.},

It is becoming increasingly clear, however, that traditional between-group comparisons have obscured the substantial heterogeneity of cognitive and affective dysfunction that is associated with depressive symptomatology. In this article, we review the findings of research examining attention to and memory for negative emotional information using a more dimensional perspective on depression. Specifically, we explore studies that assess cognitive biases along a continuum of depressive symptom severity and consider the influence of co-occurring dimensions of functioning, in particular the severity of anxiety symptoms. Finally, we identify critical empirical questions and issues in this growing literature.},

A total of 681 adolescents performed a Dot Probe Task (DPT), an Emotional Visual Search Task (EVST), and an Interpretation Recognition Task. Attention and interpretation biases were significantly correlated with anxiety. Mixed results were reported with regard to depression: evidence was found for an interpretation bias, and for an attention bias as measured with the EVST but not with the DPT. Furthermore, interpretation and attention biases predicted unique variance in anxiety and depression scores. These results indicate that attention and interpretation biases are unique processes in anxiety and depression. They also suggest that anxiety and depression are partly based on similar underlying cognitive mechanisms.},

Training yielded some improvement in performance on the numerosity-discrimination task, but only in older adolescents or adults. In contrast, training in relational reasoning improved performance on that task in all age groups, but training benefits were greater for people in late adolescence and adulthood than for people earlier in adolescence. Training did not increase performance on the face-perception task for any age group. Our findings suggest that for certain cognitive skills, training during late adolescence and adulthood yields greater improvement than training earlier in adolescence, which highlights the relevance of this late developmental stage for education.},

From an action control perspective, there are three ways in which implicit processes may support emotion regulation. First, implicit processes may allow people to decide whether or not to engage in emotion regulation, through implicit activation of emotion regulation goals and implicit monitoring of whether emotional responses are compatible with these goals. Second, implicit processes may guide people in selecting suitable emotion regulation strategies, by activating habitual strategies and by tailoring strategies to situational affordances. Third, the implicit processes recruited by habits and implementation intentions may facilitate the enactment of emotion regulation strategies. Implicit processes are thus vital in the self-regulation of emotion.},

To further investigate this claim we report two new experiments using the internal shift task (IST). In experiment 1 (N=27) we examined the stability of switching ability measured using the IST through examination of internal consistency (stability within the task) and test-retest-reliability (stability over time) over two weeks. Results indicate relatively high stability of switching ability measured with the IST. In experiment 2 the IST was administered to a pre-selected undergraduate sample of high (N=20) and low ruminators (N=20). The main findings were that rumination was related to attentional switching impairments, specifically in the context of emotional information. The switching impairments were most pronounced when negative information was held in working memory. The attentional switching impairments were most strongly related to the depressive brooding component of rumination. The results of this study lend further support to the proposed link between rumination and switching abilities.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: While considerable attention has focused on improving the detection of depression, assessment of severity is also important in guiding treatment decisions. Therefore, we examined the validity of a brief, new measure of depression severity. MEASUREMENTS: The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as ‚Äú0‚Äù (not at all) to ‚Äú3‚Äù (nearly every day). The PHQ-9 was completed by 6,000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Construct validity was assessed using the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey, selfreported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (MHP) interview in a sample of 580 patients. RESULTS: As PHQ-9 depression severity increased, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and health care utilization increased. Using the MHP reinterview as the criterion standard, a PHQ-9 score !10 had a sensitivity of 88\% and a specificity of 88\% for major depression. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. Results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples. CONCLUSION: In addition to making criteria-based diagnoses of depressive disorders, the PHQ-9 is also a reliable and valid measure of depression severity. These characteristics plus its brevity make the PHQ-9 a useful clinical and research tool.},

	abstract = {Background New indices, calculated on data from the widely used Dot Probe Task, were recently proposed to capture variability in biased attention allocation. We observed that it remains unclear which data pattern is meant to be indicative of dynamic bias and thus to be captured by these indices. Moreover, we hypothesized that the new indices are sensitive to SD differences at the response time (RT) level in the absence of bias. Method Randomly generated datasets were analyzed to assess properties of the Attention Bias Variability (ABV) and Trial Level Bias Score (TL-BS) indices. Sensitivity to creating differences in 1) RT standard deviation, 2) mean RT, and 3) bias magnitude were assessed. In addition, two possible definitions of dynamic attention bias were explored by creating differences in 4) frequency of bias switching, and 5) bias magnitude in the presence of constant switching. Results ABV and TL-BS indices were found highly sensitive to increasing SD at the response time level, insensitive to increasing bias, linearly sensitive to increasing bias magnitude in the presence of bias switches, and non-linearly sensitive to increasing the frequency of bias switches. The ABV index was also found responsive to increasing mean response times in the absence of bias. Conclusion Recently proposed DPT derived variability indices cannot uncouple measurement error from bias variability. Significant group differences may be observed even if there is no bias present in any individual dataset. This renders the new indices in their current form unfit for empirical purposes. Our discussion focuses on fostering debate and ideas for new research to validate the potentially very important notion of biased attention being dynamic.},

It draws attention to the work of McNaught (2011). He has developed a definitional framework of wellbeing, in which wellbeing is perceived to be a macro concept or area of study concerned with the objective and subjective assessment of wellbeing as a desirable human state. The framework broadens wellbeing to a range of different domains beyond individual subjectivity, which has been the traditional focus of concern, and extracts it from customary affiliations with health to incorporate the family, community and society as a whole. The framework reflects the conceptual complexity of ‚Äòwellbeing‚Äô and highlights its dependency upon a range of social, economic and environmental forces that provide the resources and the contexts for the generation and maintenance of wellbeing at all levels of society. The article argues that the framework provides a paradigm that facilitates further development and systemisation of research and knowledge in the field of wellbeing. Firstly, the framework has the capacity to bring some clarity, inclusiveness and holism to research and practice. Secondly, it is useful as a tool to enhance theoretical frameworks and to guide the design and development of both health and wellbeing interventions. Thirdly, it provides the philosophical underpinnings for wellbeing policy development.},

	abstract = {The measurement of pupil diameter in psychology (in short, ‚Äúpupillometry‚Äù) has just celebrated 50 years. The method established itself after the appearance of three seminal studies (Hess \& Polt, 1960, 1964; Kahneman \& Beatty, 1966). Since then, the method has continued to play a significant role within the field, and pupillary responses have been successfully used to provide an estimate of the ‚Äúintensity‚Äù of mental activity and of changes in mental states, particularly changes in the allocation of attention and the consolidation of perception. Remarkably, pupillary responses provide a continuous measure regardless of whether the participant is aware of such changes. More recently, research in neuroscience has revealed a tight correlation between the activity of the locus coeruleus (i.e., the ‚Äúhub‚Äù of the noradrenergic system) and pupillary dilation.As we discuss in this short review, these neurophysiological findings provide new important insights to the meaning of pupillary responses for mental activity. Finally, given that pupillary responses can be easily measured in a noninvasive manner, occur from birth, and can occur in the absence of voluntary, conscious processes, they constitute a very promising tool for the study of preverbal (e.g., infants) or nonverbal participants (e.g., animals, neurological patients).},

	abstract = {Scientists should be able to provide support for the absence of a meaningful effect. Currently, researchers often incorrectly conclude an effect is absent based a nonsignificant result. A widely recommended approach within a frequentist framework is to test for equivalence. In equivalence tests, such as the two one-sided tests (TOST) procedure discussed in this article, an upper and lower equivalence bound is specified based on the smallest effect size of interest. The TOST procedure can be used to statistically reject the presence of effects large enough to be considered worthwhile. This practical primer with accompanying spreadsheet and R package enables psychologists to easily perform equivalence tests (and power analyses) by setting equivalence bounds based on standardized effect sizes and provides recommendations to prespecify equivalence bounds. Extending your statistical tool kit with equivalence tests is an easy way to improve your statistical and theoretical inferences.},

	abstract = {Background: Meta-analyses play an important role in cumulative science by combining information across multiple studies and attempting to provide effect size estimates corrected for publication bias. Research on the reproducibility of meta-analyses reveals that errors are common, and the percentage of effect size calculations that cannot be reproduced is much higher than is desirable. Furthermore, the flexibility in inclusion criteria when performing a meta-analysis, combined with the many conflicting conclusions drawn by meta-analyses of the same set of studies performed by different researchers, has led some people to doubt whether meta-analyses can provide objective conclusions. Discussion: The present article highlights the need to improve the reproducibility of meta-analyses to facilitate the identification of errors, allow researchers to examine the impact of subjective choices such as inclusion criteria, and update the meta-analysis after several years. Reproducibility can be improved by applying standardized reporting guidelines and sharing all meta-analytic data underlying the meta-analysis, including quotes from articles to specify how effect sizes were calculated. Pre-registration of the research protocol (which can be peer-reviewed using novel ‚Äòregistered report‚Äô formats) can be used to distinguish a-priori analysis plans from data-driven choices, and reduce the amount of criticism after the results are known. Summary: The recommendations put forward in this article aim to improve the reproducibility of meta-analyses. In addition, they have the benefit of ‚Äúfuture-proofing‚Äù meta-analyses by allowing the shared data to be re-analyzed as new theoretical viewpoints emerge or as novel statistical techniques are developed. Adoption of these practices will lead to increased credibility of meta-analytic conclusions, and facilitate cumulative scientific knowledge.},

	abstract = {Psychology journals rarely publish non-significant results. At the same time, it is often very unlikely (or ‚Äòtoo good to be true‚Äô) that a set of studies yields exclusively significant results. Here, we use likelihood ratios to explain when sets of studies that contain a mix of significant and non-significant results are likely to be true, or ‚Äòtoo true to be bad‚Äô. As we show, mixed results are not only likely to be observed in lines of research, but when observed, mixed results often provide evidence for the alternative hypothesis, given reasonable levels of statistical power and an adequately controlled low Type 1 error rate. Researchers should feel comfortable submitting such lines of research with an internal meta-analysis for publication. A better understanding of probabilities, accompanied by more realistic expectations of what real lines of studies look like, might be an important step in mitigating publication bias in the scientific literature.},

The results indicated differences in the performance of one item (social well-being) for educational level, one item (social well-being) for sex, and two items (psychological well-being) for age. The MHC-SF is highly reliable over time, as there was no differential item functioning across the four timepoints. Furthermore, the means and reliabilities of the subscales were consistent over time.

As many patients do not beneÔ¨Åt from e or have difÔ¨Åculties accessing e frontline treatments, novel, effective and easy-to-deliver interventions are needed. Cognitive Bias ModiÔ¨Åcation of Interpretations (CBM-I) training has been used to treat adult anxiety disorders. CBM-I methods train individuals to endorse benign rather than negative resolutions of ambiguous cues. Developmental extensions of CBM-I are important for several reasons. First, implementing CBM-I in symptomatic children and adolescents may facilitate early preventative gains. Second, as training uses simple learning mechanisms, CBM-I may reÔ¨Çect a developmentallysuitable strategy for shaping adaptive processing styles. Third, as this age range involves protracted neurocognitive maturation and associated plasticity, administering CBM-I early could drive powerful, long-lasting beneÔ¨Åts for emotional development. Finally, data from CBM-I studies could inform the cognitive mechanisms involved in the genesis of early-emerging anxiety. This paper provides the Ô¨Årst organised review of CBM-I studies conducted in children and adolescents, and contains suggestions for future research that may help realise the therapeutic potential of early CBM-I interventions.},

Using a Monte Carlo simulation, the authors demonstrate that a higher level of unreliability in such dependent variables is associated with substantially lower levels of replicability. The results imply that this overlooked consequence can have farreaching repercussions for the development of a cumulative science.

Three hundred and twelve male and female students from two Greek Universities participated in the study, which consisted of a questionnaire battery, including measures of subjective wellbeing, character strengths and mental and physical health. Youths were found to have a positive outlook on life. Wisdom, courage and transcendence appeared to be the most salient among their character strengths, since character strengths were each highly and positively correlated with the wellbeing subscales of environmental mastery, purpose in life and self-acceptance. Good physical and mental health were positively related to, and reliably predicted different aspects of, both wellbeing and character strengths; nevertheless, mental health appeared to affect and predict more aspects of wellbeing and character strengths than physical health. The significance of the above findings for the field of positive psychology is discussed.},

Method: Here we present the development and validation of a new form of CBM designed to manipulate the cognitive errors known to characterize both depression and anxiety. Our manipulation was designed to modify the biased cognitions identiÔ¨Åed by Beck‚Äôs cognitive error categories (e.g. arbitrary inference, overgeneralisation) and typically targeted during therapy. Results: In a later test of spontaneous inferences, unselected (Experiment 1) and vulnerable participants (Experiment 2) who had generated positive alternatives rather than errors perceived novel hypothetical events, their causes and outcomes in a non-distorted manner. These groups were also less vulnerable to two different types of emotional stressor (video clips; and an imagined social situation). Furthermore participants‚Äô interpretation of their own performance on a problem-solving task was improved by the manipulation, despite actual performance showing no signiÔ¨Åcant change. Conclusions: These Ô¨Åndings demonstrate that Cognitive Error ModiÔ¨Åcation can promote positive inferences, reduce vulnerability to stress and improve self-perceptions of performance. √ì 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Background. Military training is a chronic stressful period that often induces stress-related psychopathology. Stress vulnerability and resilience depend on personality trait anxiety, attentional threat bias and prefrontal‚Äìlimbic dysfunction. However, how these neurobehavioral elements interact with regard to the development of symptoms following stress remains unclear. Method. Fifty-Ô¨Åve healthy combat soldiers undergoing intensive military training completed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) testing while performing the dot-probe task (DPT) composed of angry (threat) and neutral faces. Participants were then stratiÔ¨Åed according to their bias tendency to avoidance (n = 25) or vigilance (n = 30) groups, categorized as high or low trait anxiety and assessed for post-stress symptom severity. Results. Avoidance compared to vigilance tendency was associated with fewer post-trauma symptoms and increased hippocampal response to threat among high anxious but not low anxious individuals. Importantly, mediation analysis revealed that only among high anxious individuals did hippocampal activity lead to lower levels of symptoms through avoidance bias tendency. However, in the whole group, avoidance bias was modulated by the interplay between the hippocampus and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Conclusions. Our results provide a neurobehavioral model to explain the resilience to post-trauma symptoms following chronic exposure. The model points to the importance of considering threat bias tendency in addition to personality traits when investigating the brain response and symptoms of trauma. Such a multi-parametric approach that accounts for individual behavioral sensitivities may also improve brain-driven treatments of anxiety, possibly by targeting the interplay between the hippocampus and the dACC.},

As empirical research on resilience has burgeoned in recent years, criticisms have been levied at work in this area. These critiques have generally focused on ambiguities in definitions and central terminology; heterogeneity in risks experienced and competence achieved by individuals viewed as resilient; instability of the phenomenon of resilience; and concerns regarding the usefulness of resilience as a theoretical construct. We address each identified criticism in turn, proposing solutions for those we view as legitimate and clarifying misunderstandings surrounding those we believe to be less valid. We conclude that work on resilience possesses substantial potential for augmenting the understanding of processes affecting at-risk individuals. Realization of the potential embodied by this construct, however, will remain constrained without continued scientific attention to some of the serious conceptual and methodological pitfalls that have been noted by skeptics and proponents alike.},

	abstract = {In this review of research concerning anxiety-linked attentional bias, we seek to illustrate a general principle that we contend applies across the breadth of experimental psychopathology. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we highlight how maintenance of a clear distinction between process and procedure serves to enhance the advancement of knowledge and understanding, while failure to maintain this distinction can foster confusion and misconception. We show how such clear differentiation has permitted the continuous reÔ¨Ånement of assessment procedures, in ways that have led to growing conÔ¨Ådence in the existence of the putative attentional bias process of interest, and also increasing understanding of its nature. In contrast, we show how a failure to consistently differentiate between process and procedure has contributed to confusion concerning whether or not attentional bias modiÔ¨Åcation reliably alters anxiety vulnerability and dysfunction. As we demonstrate, such confusion can be avoided by distinguishing the process of attentional bias modiÔ¨Åcation from the procedures that have been employed with the intention of evoking this target process. Such an approach reveals that procedures adopted with the intention of eliciting the attentional bias modiÔ¨Åcation process do not always do so, but that successful evocation of the attentional bias modiÔ¨Åcation process quite reliably alters anxiety symptomatology. We consider some of the speciÔ¨Åc implications for future research concerning attentional bias modiÔ¨Åcation, while also pointing to the broader implications for experimental psychopathology research in general.},

	abstract = {Previous research has established that high levels of trait anxiety commonly are associated with an automatic pattern of encoding selectivity, operating to favour the processing of emotionally threatening information. It has been suggested that this processing bias may play a functional role in mediating emotional vulnerability by moderating affective responses to stressful real life events. The current experiment employs a longitudinal design, capable of addressing the central predictions arising from this theoretical position. Thirty-one women awaiting colposcopy investigation were screened on both traditional questionnaire measures of emotional vulnerability, and on a modified emotional Stroop task that provided objective indices of their automatic and strategic patterns of processing selectivity. Subsequently, those 15 women who later received a diagnosis ofcer\&al pathology reported the degr\& to which this diagnosis had impaired their level of emotional functioning. The results confirm that, at the initial test time, Gait anxiety was indeed associated with an apparently automatic tendency to se.l\&tively process threat related distractor information. Furthermore, an index of this initial pattern of automatic processing selectivity was consistently the best predictor of the intensity of emotional distress elicited by the subsequent diagnosis of cervical pathology. None of our conventional questionnaire measures were capable of significantly predicting this later emotional response. We suggest that these findings offer empirical support for the hypotheses that patterns of automatic processing selectivity may moderate individuals‚Äô emotional responses to stressful life events.},

After considering the purpose and nature of CBM methodologies, we show that variants designed to modify selective attention (CBM-A) or interpretation (CBM-I) have proven capable of reducing anxiety vulnerability and ameliorating dysfunctional anxiety. In addition to supporting the causal role of cognitive bias in anxiety vulnerability and dysfunction and illuminating the mechanisms that underpin such bias, the Ô¨Åndings suggest that CBM procedures may have therapeutic promise within clinical settings.

	abstract = {Objective: The Attention Network Test (ANT) is a tool used to assess the efÔ¨Åciency of the 3 attention networks‚Äîalerting, orienting, and executive control. The ANT has become popular in the neuropsychological literature since its Ô¨Årst description in 2002, with some form of the task currently appearing in no less than 65 original research papers. Although several general reviews of the ANT exist, none provide an analysis of its psychometric properties. Method: Data from 15 unique studies were collected, resulting in a large sample (N œ≠ 1,129) of healthy individuals. Split-half reliability, variance structure, distribution shape, and independence of measurement of the 3 attention network scores were analyzed, considering both reaction time and accuracy as dependent variables. Results: Split-half reliabilities of reaction time based attention network scores were low for alerting (rweighted œ≠ .20, CI 95\%weighted [.14, .27], Spearman‚ÄìBrown r œ≠ .38) and orienting (rweighted œ≠ .32, CI 95\%weighted [.26, .38], Spearman‚ÄìBrown r œ≠ .55), and moderate high for executive control (rweighted œ≠ .65, CI 95\%weighted [.61, .71], Spearman‚ÄìBrown r œ≠ .81). Analysis of the variance structure of the ANT indicated that power to Ô¨Ånd signiÔ¨Åcant effects was variable across networks and dependent on the statistical analysis being used. Both analysis of variance (signiÔ¨Åcant interaction observed in 100\% of 15 studies) and correlational analyses (multiplesigniÔ¨Åcant inter-network correlations observed) suggest that the networks measured by the ANT are not independent. Conclusions: In the collection, analysis and interpretation of any test data, psychometric properties, such as those reported here for the ANT, must be carefully considered.},

But, there are still many unresolved conceptual and research issues, as more variables are being proposed as relevant. As part of this process, the present paper proposes hardiness as an addition to positive psychology. Hardiness is a combination of attitudes that provides the courage and motivation to do the hard, strategic work of turning stressful circumstances from potential disasters into growth opportunities. In this regard, the inherently stressful nature of living is discussed. Also clarified are the particular aspects of excellence in performance and health to which hardiness is relevant. The paper concludes with a call for issue-resolving research through which orientations and actions proposed as part of positive psychology can be compared in their contributions to performance and health. Two studies along these lines have found hardiness more powerful than optimism and religiousness in coping with stresses.},

Although several measures of RNT are available, the items of most of these instruments index RNT that is speciÔ¨Åc to particular diagnostic groups (e.g., RNT about depression symptoms). This has limited our ability to examine the relevance of RNT across diagnostic groups and advance our understanding of RNT as a transdiagnostic process. This study evaluated the psychometric properties of the Repetitive Thinking Questionnaire (RTQ), a transdiagnostic measure of RNT. In a clinical sample of individuals with anxiety and depressive disorders (N = 186), the RTQ demonstrated good internal consistency, convergent, and divergent validity. Supporting the transdiagnostic nature of the measure, the Repetitive Negative Thinking subscale of the RTQ was associated with a variety of negative emotions and metacognitive beliefs, and signiÔ¨Åcantly predicted symptoms of multiple disorders when controlling for neuroticism. Our Ô¨Åndings support the use of the RTQ as a transdiagnostic, trans-emotional measure of maladaptive repetitive thought following distressing events, with scope to increase efÔ¨Åciency and reduce burden on patients by assessing RNT in clinical settings with one short measure. Experimental and longitudinal research identifying mechanisms driving RNT using the RTQ would be informative for theory and treatment developments.},

A new affective task-switching paradigm that required participants to shift between categorizing positive and negative affective pictures according to emotional or nonemotional features was used to assess individual differences in affective flexibility. The results showed that greater affective flexibility (less switch costs) predicted the ability to use reappraisal to down-regulate emotions in response to a sad film clip. In particular, more efficient shifts toward the neutral aspects of negative pictures and toward the emotional aspects of positive pictures were found to predict reappraisal ability. The results imply that executive control of emotional material is a capacity that is closely associated with effective reappraisal.},

The aim of Study 1 was to examine whether previously demonstrated relationships between post-stressor RNT and mechanisms theorized to drive engagement in RNT, including metacognitive beliefs, cognitive avoidance strategies, and thought control strategies, would be replicated with anticipatory (pre-stressor) RNT. The aim of Study 2 was to replicate these associations in a new sample that completed measures of both pre- and post-stressor RNT. Method: Participants in Study 1 (N ¬º 175) completed the RNT-L in anticipation of a stressor, along with measures of metacognitive beliefs, cognitive avoidance strategies, and thought control strategies. Participants in Study 2 (N ¬º 91) completed the measures both before and after a stressor. Results: Preand post-stressor RNT were signiÔ¨Åcantly correlated with all three mechanism measures. Metacognitive beliefs that RNT is uncontrollable and dangerous, and the thought control strategy of punishment, were most consistently and uniquely associated with RNT at both time-points. Limitations: Replication with clinical samples and with reference to a broader array of stressors is required. The correlational design precluded causal conclusions. Conclusions: Common and possibly some distinct mechanisms drive RNT before and after a stressor. √ì 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Repetitive negative thinking (RNT) increases vulnerability to multiple anxiety and depressive disorders and, as a common risk factor, elevated RNT may account for the high levels of comorbidity observed between emotional disorders. The aims of this study were to (a) compare two common forms of RNT (worry and rumination) across individuals with non-comorbid anxiety or depressive disorders, and (b) to examine the relationship between RNT and comorbidity. Methods: A structured diagnostic interview and measures of rumination, worry, anxiety, and depression were completed by a large clinical sample with an anxiety disorder or depression (N¬º 513) presenting at a community mental health clinic. Results: Patients without (n ¬º 212) and with (n ¬º 301) comorbid diagnoses did not generally differ across the principal diagnosis groups (depression, generalised anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder) on worry or rumination. As predicted, comorbidity was associated with a higher level of RNT. Limitations: Cross-sectional design precluded causal conclusions and Ô¨Åndings may not generalize to excluded anxiety disorders. Conclusions: Consistent with the transdiagnostic hypothesis, RNT was associated with a range of anxiety disorders and depression and with comorbidity for those with a principal depressive disorder, supporting recent evidence that RNT is a transdiagnostic process. The presence of RNT, speciÔ¨Åcally worry and rumination, should be assessed and treated regardless of diagnostic proÔ¨Åle. Future research may show that both pure and comorbid depressed or anxious patients receive incremental beneÔ¨Åt from transdiagnostic protocols developed to treat core pathological processes of RNT traditionally associated with separate disorders.},

Probes always replaced the positive face, and subjects pushed a button to indicate the identity of the probe (E or F) as rapidly as possible. In the inverse condition, the probes always replaced the negative face, and in the control condition, the probes replaced each face type equally often. After four training sessions, all groups exhibited statistically indistinguishable, but signiÔ¨Åcant, reductions on self-report, behavioral, and physiological measures of speech anxiety. Self-report and behavioral measures of attentional control improved likewise. Contrary to early studies, ABM was not superior to control procedures in producing reductions on measures of social anxiety.},

In contrast to viewing symptoms as reÔ¨Çective of underlying, latent categories or dimensions, network analysis conceptualizes symptoms as constitutive of mental disorders, not reÔ¨Çective of them. Disorders emerge from the causal interactions among symptoms themselves, and intervening on central symptoms in disorder networks promises to foster rapid recovery. One purpose of this article is to contrast network analysis with traditional approaches, and consider its strengths and limitations. A second purpose is to review novel computational methods that may enable researchers to discern the causal structure of disorders (e.g., Bayesian networks).

	abstract = {This article presents a measure of individual differences in the tendencies to worry constructively and unconstructively, called the Constructive and Unconstructive Worry Questionnaire (CUWQ). The measure is based on a control theory perspective of worry and separates the tendency to worry in a way that facilitates goal-pursuit and threat reduction (constructive worry) from the tendency to worry in a way that hinders goal-pursuit while sustaining threat awareness (unconstructive worry). CUWQ scores were validated in 2 independent nonclinical samples, including North American (Sample 1, N œ≠ 295) and Australian (Sample 2, N œ≠ 998) residents. Final factor items were selected based on Sample 1, and the measure showed good model fit through a confirmatory factor analysis in Sample 2. In addition, scores on the 2 worry factors showed criterion-related validity by statistically predicting a variety of outcomes in both samples: Constructive worry was positively associated with punctuality and wildfire preparedness and negatively associated with trait-anxiety and amount of worry. Unconstructive worry, on the other hand, was positively associated with trait-anxiety and amount of worry, and negatively associated with punctuality and wildfire preparedness. The 2 factor scores were uncorrelated in Sample 1 and positively correlated in Sample 2, thereby showing that having a tendency to worry in an unconstructive manner does not prohibit 1 from worrying in a constructive manner as well. Understanding how the 2 tendencies to worry differ from each other and separating their measurement enables a better understanding of the role of worry in both normal behavior and psychopathology.},

Data-bases were searched with the key words ‚Äò‚Äòinterpret* bias AND training‚Äô‚Äô and ‚Äò‚Äòinterpret* bias AND modif*‚Äô‚Äô. Reference lists of identified articles were checked and authors of identified articles were contacted for further relevant articles and unpublished data. Studies were reviewed for inclusion with eligibility criteria being that the study (a) aimed to target interpretation biases through any kind of training, (b) assessed mood and/or interpretation bias as outcome measures, (c) allocated individuals to training conditions at random, and (d) recruited adult samples. A meta-analytic multilevel mixed-effects model was employed to assess standardized mean changes in interpretation bias, negative mood, and emotional reactivity. In addition, several training and sample characteristics were explored for their potential to enhance benign training effectiveness. On average, benign CBM-I resulted in an increase in positive interpretation bias (p, .01) and a decrease in negative mood state (p,.001), but did not affect emotional reactivity. These effects were not consistently different from control conditions with no or neutral training. However, within benign training conditions imagery instructions and more training sessions were related to larger cognitive and mood effects, whereas feedback about training performance and inclusion of non-benign training items (instead of including benign items only) boosted cognitive effects only. Finally, training was more effective in women (cognitive and mood effects) and presumably samples with symptomatic emotional dysregulation (cognitive effects). Although the effects of emotional dysregulation and number of training sessions could not well be distinguished, there is an indication that when used with imagery instructions and more training sessions, benign CBM-I can be employed as a useful complementary treatment to usual psychotherapies.},

Study 1 (N = 326) examined the role of trait AP, worry, and rumination in predicting symptoms of social anxiety, depression, and trait anxiety and found that all three RNT styles predicted social anxiety, but only worry predicted trait anxiety and only rumination predicted depressive symptoms. Study 2 (N = 353) used a prospective design to examine how cognitions and symptoms reciprocally interact and found that only worry predicted future social anxiety, but social anxiety predicted later AP and rumination. Results suggest worry may serve as a risk factor for social anxiety, whereas AP and rumination may serve as maintenance factors.

Drawing participants from higher-income and lower-income backgrounds, we tested how adults who grew up in harsh or unpredictable environments fared on 2 types of executive function tasks: inhibition and shifting. People who experienced unpredictable childhoods performed worse at inhibition (overriding dominant responses), but performed better at shifting (efficiently switching between different tasks). This finding is consistent with the notion that shifting, but not inhibition, is especially useful in unpredictable environments. Importantly, differences in executive function between people who experienced unpredictable versus predictable childhoods emerged only when they were tested in uncertain contexts. This catalyst suggests that some individual differences related to early life experience are manifested under conditions of uncertainty in adulthood. Viewed as a whole, these findings indicate that adverse childhood environments do not universally impair mental functioning, but can actually enhance specific types of cognitive performance in the face of uncertainty.},

We hypothesized that need satisfaction is a mediator of the relationship between feelings of esteem for one‚Äôs community and several widely employed measures of wellbeing among a sample of residents living in an urban community in the United States. In accord with the primary hypotheses, the results revealed a robust association between community esteem and both hedonic and eudaimonic measures of wellbeing.

	abstract = {An ever-growing number of transdiagnostic processes that maintain psychopathology across disorders have been identified. However, such processes are not consistently associated with psychological distress and symptoms. An understanding of what makes such processes pathological is required. One possibility is that individual differences in rigidity in the implementation of these processes determine the degree of psychopathology. The aim of this article is to examine the relationship between rigidity/flexibility and transdiagnostic maintenance processes. Initial searches were made for research examining relationships between 18 transdiagnostic processes and rigidity/flexibility. Relationships between rumination, perfectionism, impulsivity and compulsivity, and rigidity/flexibility were systemically reviewed; 50 studies met inclusion criteria. The majority of studies indicated that transdiagnostic cognitive and behavioral maintenance processes and rigidity were correlated, co-occurring, or predictive of each other. Findings are consistent with the hypothesis that it is inflexibility in the manner in which processes are employed that makes them pathologically problematic. However, further research is required to test and establish this.},

Computerized cognitive training (CCT) paradigms offer potential to improve cognition, mood and everyday functioning, but their effectiveness is not well established. The goal of this article was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the efÔ¨Åcacy of CCT in depressive disorders. Method: A search was conducted to identify high quality randomized controlled CCT trials per PRISMA guidelines using PsycINFO and MEDLINE with the keywords ‚ÄúCognitive training‚Äù or ‚ÄúCognitive remediation‚Äù or ‚ÄúCognitive rehabilitation‚Äù and ‚ÄúDepression‚Äù. 9 randomized trials for depressed adults met inclusion criteria. Effect sizes (Hedge's g) were calculated for key outcome measures of mood symptom severity, daily functioning, and cognition. A 3-level Bayesian hierarchical linear model was used to estimate effect sizes for each domain and study. Publication bias was assessed using Classic Fail Safe N's and homogeneity was evaluated using Q and I2 indexes. Results: SigniÔ¨Åcant small-moderate effects for Symptom Severity (0.43) and Daily Functioning (0.72), and moderate-large effects for Attention (0.67), Working Memory (0.72), and Global Functioning (1.05) were found. No signiÔ¨Åcant effects were found for Executive Functioning or Verbal Memory. Moderator variable analysis revealed decreased effect of CCT with age. Gender and concurrent medication treatment did not affect the results. Limitations: Small sample size, short duration, pseudo-speciÔ¨Åcity, and high heterogeneity for Verbal Memory measures. Conclusions: CCT is associated with improvement in depressive symptoms and everyday functioning, though produces inconsistent effects on cognition.},

	abstract = {Objective: Cortisol is elevated in individuals with both increased emotional stress and higher percentages of body fat. Cortisol is also known to affect cognitive performance, particularly spatial processing and working memory. We hypothesized that increased body fat might therefore be associated with decreased performance on a spatial processing task, in response to an acute real-world stressor. Design: We tested two separate samples of participants undergoing their first (tandem) skydive. In the first sample (N ¬º 78), participants were tested for salivary cortisol and state anxiety (Spielberger State Anxiety Scale) during the plane‚Äôs 15-min ascent to altitude in immediate anticipation of the jump. In a second sample (N ¬º 20), participants were tested for salivary cortisol, as well as cardiac variables (heart rate, autonomic regulation through heart rate variability) and performance on a cognitive task of spatial processing, selective attention and working memory. Results: In response to the skydive, individuals with greater body fat percentages showed significantly increased reactivity for both cortisol (on both samples) and cognition, including decreased accuracy of our task of spatial processing, selective attention and working memory. These cognitive effects were restricted to the stress response and were not found under baseline conditions. There were no body fat interactions with cardiac changes in response to the stressor, suggesting that the cognitive effects were specifically hormone mediated rather than secondary to general activation of the autonomic nervous system. Conclusions: Our results indicate that, under real-world stress, increased body fat may be associated with endocrine stress vulnerability, with consequences for deleterious cognitive performance.

	abstract = {Background and objectives: Attentional bias modiÔ¨Åcation (ABM) is a potentially exciting new development in the treatment of anxiety disorders. However, reported therapeutic beneÔ¨Åts have not always been replicated. To gauge the sensitivity of tasks used in ABM treatment and assessment, we used a counterbalanced within-subject design to measure their discriminant sensitivity to neutral and threatening facial expressions, comparing them with other well-known tasks that measure visual attention. Methods: We compared two tasks often used in the assessment and treatment of attention bias (the dotprobe and the spatial cueing paradigms) with two well-known visual attention tasks (the irrelevant singleton and attentional blink paradigms), measuring their sensitivity to processing differences between threatening and neutral expressions for non-clinical observers. Results: The dot-probe, spatial cueing and irrelevant singleton paradigms showed little or no sensitivity to processing differences between facial expressions while the attentional blink task proved very sensitive to such differences. Furthermore, the attentional blink task provided an intriguing picture of the temporal dynamics of attentional biases that the other paradigms cannot do. Limitations: These results need to be replicated with larger samples, including a comparison of a group of individuals diagnosed with social anxiety disorder and normal controls. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the sensitivity of putative attentional bias measures should be assessed experimentally for more powerful assessment and treatment of such biases. If the attentional blink task is indeed particularly sensitive to attentional biases, as our Ô¨Åndings indicate, it is not unreasonable to expect that interventions based on this task may be more effective than those based on the tasks that are currently used.},

	abstract = {Health Psychologists using questionnaires rely heavily on Cronbach‚Äôs alpha as indicator of scale reliability and internal consistency. Cronbach‚Äôs alpha is often viewed as some kind of quality label: high values certify scale quality, low values prompt removal of one or several items. Unfortunately, this approach suffers two fundamental problems. First, Cronbach‚Äôs alpha is both unrelated to a scale's internal consistency and a fatally flawed estimate of its reliability. Second, the approach itself assumes that scale items are repeated measurements, an assumption that is often violated and rarely desirable. The problems with Cronbach‚Äôs alpha are easily solved by computing readily available alternatives, such as the Greatest Lower Bound or Omega. Solving the second problem, however, is less straightforward. This requires forgoing the appealing comfort of a quantitative, seemingly objective indicator of scale quality altogether, instead acknowledging the dynamics of reliability and validity and the distinction between scales and indices. In this contribution, I will explore these issues, and provide recommendations for scale inspection that takes these dynamics and this distinction into account.},

	abstract = {Background and Objectives: Abnormal threat-related attention in anxiety disorders is most commonly assessed and modified using the dot-probe paradigm; however, poor psychometric properties of reaction-time measures may contribute to inconsistencies across studies. Typically, standard attention measures are derived using average reaction-times obtained in experimentallydefined conditions. However, current approaches based on experimentally-defined conditions are limited. In this study, the psychometric properties of a novel response-based computation approach to analyze dot-probe data are compared to standard measures of attention. Methods: 148 adults (19.19 ¬± 1.42, 84 women) completed a standardized dot-probe task including threatening and neutral faces. We generated both standard and response-based measures of attention bias, attentional orientation, and attentional disengagement. We compared overall internal consistency, number of trials necessary to reach internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and criterion validity obtained using each approach. Results: Compared to standard attention measures, response-based measures demonstrated uniformly high levels of internal consistency with relatively few trials and varying improvements in test-retest reliability. Additionally, response-based measures demonstrated specific evidence of anxiety-related associations above and beyond both standard attention measures and other confounds. Limitations: Future studies are necessary to validate this approach in clinical samples. Conclusions: Response-based attention measures demonstrate superior psychometric properties compared to standard attention measures, which may improve the detection of anxiety-related associations and treatment-related changes in clinical samples.},

It remains unclear whether those with GAD experience more dysregulated emotions during periods of euthymia and positive affect or whether these deÔ¨Åcits occur only during periods of worry. Individuals with GAD (with and without co-occurring dysphoria) and non-anxious controls were randomly assigned to receive a worry, neutral, or relaxation induction. Following the induction, all participants viewed a Ô¨Ålm clip documented to elicit sadness. Intensity of emotions and emotion regulation were examined following the induction period and Ô¨Ålm clip. The results revealed that, regardless of co-occurring dysphoria, individuals with GAD in the worry condition experienced more intense depressed affect than GAD participants in the other conditions and controls participants. In contrast, presence of worry appeared to have less impact on indices of emotion dysregulation, which were greater in participants with GAD compared to controls, but largely insensitive to contextual effects of worry or of relaxation. Following Ô¨Ålm viewing, both GAD participants with and without dysphoria displayed poorer understanding, acceptance, and management of emotions than did controls. However, acceptance and management deÔ¨Åcits were most pronounced in individuals with both GAD and co-occurring dysphoria. Implications for the role of emotions in conceptualization and treatment of GAD are discussed.},

LRP, but not mu-MRAA or beta-MRAA, was sensitive to manipulation of the probability that advance preparation of response hand would be useful in a response precuing task. These dissociations replicate earlier findings and suggest that movement-related cortical rhythms and cortical potentials are associated with distinct preparatory component processes that differ in terms of level of abstraction and effort, in line with similar functional distinctions between component processes underlying executive control in task switching. This suggests that a fine-grained analysis of subprocesses involved in motor control may provide important guiding principles for the study and understanding of levels and mechanisms of cognitive control.},

In this review, we investigate to what extent these causal claims are supported by sound empirical evidence. Although differences in attentional bias are associated with differences in fear and anxiety, this association does not emerge consistently. Moreover, there is only limited evidence that individual differences in attentional bias are related to individual differences in fear or anxiety. In line with a causal relation, some studies show that attentional bias precedes fear or anxiety in time. However, other studies show that fear and anxiety can precede the onset of attentional bias, suggesting circular or reciprocal causality. Importantly, a recent line of experimental research shows that changes in attentional bias can lead to changes in anxiety. Yet changes in fear and anxiety also lead to changes in attentional bias, which confirms that the relation between attentional bias and fear and anxiety is unlikely to be unidirectional. Finally, a similar causal relation between interpretation bias and anxiety has been documented. In sum, there is evidence in favor of causality, yet a strict unidirectional cause‚Äì effect model is unlikely to hold. The relation between attentional bias and fear and anxiety is best described as a bidirectional, maintaining, or mutually reinforcing relation.},

	abstract = {Background and objectives: Dysfunctional cognitions are known to emerge in stressful situations and are critical for the onset of depressive symptoms. The goal of this study is to investigate whether adaptive and/or maladaptive emotion regulation strategies moderate the relationship between dysfunctional attitudes and depressive symptoms under stress. Methods: In a longitudinal study, 92 healthy but unselected undergraduates were followed for three months including a stress period (four weeks of examinations). Results: Our Ô¨Åndings demonstrate that the more adaptive emotion regulation strategies are used in daily life (measured at baseline), the weaker the relationship between dysfunctional attitudes and depressive symptoms during stress. Interestingly, no single strategy demonstrates a unique predictive value, but only the combination of several adaptive strategies moderates the relationship between dysfunctional attitudes and depressive symptoms. Although participants with elevated depressive symptoms use more maladaptive emotion regulation strategies, these latter strategies do not moderate the association between dysfunctional attitudes and depressive symptoms. Limitations: The use of a sample of undergraduates limits the generalizability and the clinical signiÔ¨Åcance of our results. Conclusions: Altogether, although dysfunctional attitudes are activated and accessible in response to certain life stressors, the strategies that healthy individuals use to adaptively regulate these cognitions seem important in determining the likelihood of depressive symptoms.},

	abstract = {Emotions can occur during an emotion-eliciting event, but they can also arise when anticipating the event. We used pupillary responses, as a measure of effortful cognitive processing, to test whether the anticipation of an emotional stimulus (positive and negative) inÔ¨Çuences the subsequent online processing of that emotional stimulus. Moreover, we tested whether individual differences in the habitual use of emotion regulation strategies are associated with pupillary responses during the anticipation and/or online processing of this emotional stimulus. Our results show that, both for positive and negative stimuli, pupillary diameter during the anticipation of emotion-eliciting events is inversely and strongly correlated to pupillary responses during the emotional image presentation. The variance in this temporal interplay between anticipation and online processing was related to individual differences in emotion regulation. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the results show that high reappraisal scores are related to larger pupil diameter during the anticipation which is related to smaller pupillary responses during the online processing of emotion-eliciting events. The habitual use of expressive suppression was not associated to pupillary responses in the anticipation and subsequent online processing of emotional stimuli. Taken together, the current data suggest (most strongly for individuals scoring high on the habitual use of reappraisal) that larger pupillary responses during the anticipation of an emotional stimulus are indicative of a sustained attentional set activation to prepare for an upcoming emotional stimulus, which subsequently directs a reduced need to cognitively process that emotional event. Hence, because the habitual use of reappraisal is known to have a positive inÔ¨Çuence on emotional well-being, the interplay between anticipation and online processing of emotional stimuli might be a signiÔ¨Åcant marker of this well-being.},

Fifty-nine healthy adult volunteers received rigged social feedback (criticism and praise) based on their photograph. Gaze data were collected to investigate processes of attentional deployment/allocation toward the self or the evaluator expressing criticism or praise. Whereas voluntary attention was directed to evaluators who expressed praise, attention was drawn to one‚Äôs own picture after criticism. Pupil dilation and heart-rate variability were larger in response to criticism as compared to praise, suggesting a flexible and adaptive emotion regulatory effort in response to social information that triggers an affective response. Altogether, healthy individuals recruited more regulatory resources to cope with negative (as compared to positive) social feedback, and this processing of social feedback was associated with adjustments in self-focused attention.},

	abstract = {The credibility revolution (sometimes referred to as the ‚Äúreplicability crisis‚Äù) in psychology has brought about many changes in the standards by which psychological science is evaluated. These changes include (a) greater emphasis on transparency and openness, (b) a move toward preregistration of research, (c) more direct-replication studies, and (d) higher standards for the quality and quantity of evidence needed to make strong scientific claims. What are the implications of these changes for productivity, creativity, and progress in psychological science? These questions can and should be studied empirically, and I present my predictions here. The productivity of individual researchers is likely to decline, although some changes (e.g., greater collaboration, data sharing) may mitigate this effect. The effects of these changes on creativity are likely to be mixed: Researchers will be less likely to pursue risky questions; more likely to use a broad range of methods, designs, and populations; and less free to define their own best practices and standards of evidence. Finally, the rate of scientific progress‚Äîthe most important shared goal of scientists‚Äîis likely to increase as a result of these changes, although one‚Äôs subjective experience of making progress will likely become rarer.},

Over the last few years, academic debate has, from a scientific perspective, gone back to two ancient philosophical orientations, namely hedonism and eudaimonia. The hedonic approach conceives well-being as the presence of positive affect and lack of negative affect, whilst the eudaimonic perspective regards well-being as the consequence of a full psychological actualization from which people develop their whole potential. Whether assessed from a hedonic or eudaimonic perspective, well-being seems to play a role in the prevention of and in the recovery of physical conditions and diseases and so possibly contributes to an increase in life expectancy. Finally, the implications of these findings are discussed both from an academic perspective and, more generally speaking, from a social and political point of view.},

Few studies have compared the association of different types of biases and events with depression.

Three types of childhood events were assessed in 83 neverdepressed and 337 formerly depressed individuals: trauma within the family, trauma outside the family, and adverse events. Furthermore, after a sad mood induction procedure, participants executed a Dot Probe task (selective attentional bias), an Emotional Stroop task (attentional interference bias) and an incidental learning task (memory bias). The association of these measures with case status and recurrence status (one or multiple past episodes) was examined. Negative memory bias and traumatic childhood events within the family were associated with case status, whereas none of the bias measures or childhood events variables were associated with recurrence status. The results indicate that memory bias as well as the experience of aggression and/or abuse within the family during childhood are independently associated with depression.

We show that these correlations are higher than should be expected given the (evidently limited) reliability of both fMRI and personality measures. The high correlations are all the more puzzling because method sections rarely contain much detail about how the correlations were obtained. We surveyed authors of 55 articles that reported Ô¨Åndings of this kind to determine a few details on how these correlations were computed. More than half acknowledged using a strategy that computes separate correlations for individual voxels and reports means of only those voxels exceeding chosen thresholds. We show how this nonindependent analysis inÔ¨Çates correlations while yielding reassuring-looking scattergrams. This analysis technique was used to obtain the vast majority of the implausibly high correlations in our survey sample. In addition, we argue that, in some cases, other analysis problems likely created entirely spurious correlations. We outline how the data from these studies could be reanalyzed with unbiased methods to provide accurate estimates of the correlations in question and urge authors to perform such reanalyses.

One hundred sixty participants completed an anxious or calm mood induction followed by dot probe and emotional cueing tasks. Reliability estimates for bias scores in the full sample were low, ranging from 0 to .44; convergent validity estimates were also poor.

	abstract = {Over the years, researchers in psychological science have documented and investigated a host of powerful cognitive fallacies, including hindsight bias and confirmation bias. Researchers themselves may not be immune to these fallacies and may unwittingly adjust their statistical analysis to produce an outcome that is more pleasant or better in line with prior expectations. To shield researchers from the impact of cognitive fallacies, several methodologists are now advocating preregistration‚Äîthat is, the creation of a detailed analysis plan before data collection or data analysis. One may argue, however, that preregistration is out of touch with academic reality, hampering creativity and impeding scientific progress. We provide a historical overview to show that the interplay between creativity and verification has shaped theories of scientific inquiry throughout the centuries; in the currently dominant theory, creativity and verification operate in succession and enhance one another‚Äôs effectiveness. From this perspective, the use of preregistration to safeguard the verification stage will help rather than hinder the generation of fruitful new ideas.},

Three components of emotions are traditionally distinguished: valence (the pleasantness of the stimulus), arousal (the intensity of emotion provoked by the stimulus), and dominance (the degree of control exerted by the stimulus). Thus far, nearly all research has been based on the ANEW norms collected by Bradley and Lang (1999) for 1,034 words. We extend the database to nearly 14 thousand English lemmas, providing researchers with a much richer source of information, including information on gender, age and educational differences in emotion norms. As an example of the new possibilities, we included the stimuli from nearly all category norms (types of diseases, occupations, and taboo words) collected by Van Overschelde, Rawson,and Dunlosky (2004), making it possible to include affect in studies on semantic memory.},

Sources of evidence for this distinction come from genetic, self-report and neurophysiological data from adults. The present study examined whether this distinction relates to cognitive processes, indexed by attention bias towards threat, which is thought to cause and maintain anxiety disorders. Method. Diagnostic and attention bias data were analysed from 435 children between 5 and 13 years of age; 158 had principal fear disorder (speciÔ¨Åc phobia, social phobia or separation anxiety disorder), 75 had principal distress disorder (generalized anxiety disorder, GAD) and 202 had no psychiatric disorder. Anxious children were a clinic-based treatment-seeking sample. Attention bias was assessed on a visual-probe task with angry, neutral and happy faces. Results. Compared to healthy controls, children with principal distress disorder (GAD) showed a signiÔ¨Åcant bias towards threat relative to neutral faces whereas children with principal fear disorder showed an attention bias away from threat relative to neutral faces. Overall, children displayed an attention bias towards happy faces, irrespective of diagnostic group. Conclusions. Our Ô¨Åndings support the distinction between fear and distress disorders, and extend empirically derived structural models of emotional disorders to threat processing in childhood, when many anxiety disorders begin and predict lifetime impairment.},

	abstract = {Field studies and laboratory experiments have documented that a key component of resilience is emotional flexibility‚Äîthe ability to respond flexibly to changing emotional circumstances. In the present study we tested the hypotheses that resilient people exhibit emotional flexibility: (a) in response to frequently changing emotional stimuli and (b) across multiple modalities of emotional responding. As participants viewed a series of emotional pictures, we assessed their self-reported affect, facial muscle activity, and startle reflexes. Higher trait resilience predicted more divergent affective and facial responses (corrugator and zygomatic) to positive versus negative pictures. Thus, compared with their low-resilient counterparts, resilient people appear to be able to more flexibly match their emotional responses to the frequently changing emotional stimuli. Moreover, whereas high-trait-resilient participants exhibited divergent startle responses to positive versus negative pictures regardless of the valence of the preceding trial, low-trait-resilient participants did not exhibit divergent startle responses when the preceding picture was negative. High-trait-resilient individuals, therefore, appear to be better able than are their low-resilient counterparts to either switch or maintain their emotional responses depending on whether the emotional context changes. The present findings broaden our understanding of the mechanisms underlying resilience by demonstrating that resilient people are able to flexibly change their affective and physiological responses to match the demands of frequently changing environmental circumstances.},

Using an anonymous elicitation format supplemented by incentives for honest reporting, we surveyed over 2,000 psychologists about their involvement in questionable research practices. The impact of truth-telling incentives on self-admissions of questionable research practices was positive, and this impact was greater for practices that respondents judged to be less defensible. Combining three different estimation methods, we found that the percentage of respondents who have engaged in questionable practices was surprisingly high. This finding suggests that some questionable practices may constitute the prevailing research norm.},

Interpretation bias was measured by means of a scrambled sentence test, which was presented both before and after the CBM procedure. Participants who read the positive statements made more positive resolutions to the scrambled sentences, while participants who read the negative statements made more negative resolutions. Thus, the appropriate positive and negative interpretative biases were induced by the CBM procedure. However, signiÔ¨Åcant mood changes also occurred following CBM. In Experiment 2, a musical mood induction procedure was presented with depressing or elating music. As before, a scrambled sentence test was presented both before and after the musical mood induction. Mood changed in accordance with the valence of the music to the same extent as with CBM. Critically however, performance on the scrambled sentence task did not change for both groups. This demonstrates that a change in mood state is not sufÔ¨Åcient for a change in cognitive bias to occur.},

Recent developments of the task have favoured the use of human faces as stimuli, however, results from this task have been inconsistent. In 2005, Schmukle published very poor reliability estimates for two versions of the dot-probe task using words and situational images as stimuli. The present study tested the reliability of two versions of the test, using photographs of human faces. One version was similar to previous research, while the other was a modification designed to meet a potential methodological issue. Results indicate that both versions tested were unreliable and therefore unsuitable for individual differences research. When considered as a group, however, participants showed consistent attentional bias towards emotional faces in the task similar to previous research, while habituation effects were found in the modified task. This suggests that the two tasks may be used in between-group designs to investigate different aspects of attention to emotional faces.},

	abstract = {This is the first study to examine attentional control capacities in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). GAD is characterized by uncontrollable worry. Individuals diagnosed with GAD and healthy participants (HPs) performed a random key-pressing task while thinking about a worrisome or a positive future event, to assess the extent to which attentional control resources are used by worry. Attentional control was also assessed when participants were not instructed to think about a specific topic using the N-back task, which varies in task difficulty, and therefore is sensitive to subtle differences in ability to handle increasing demands on attentional control within the same paradigm. GAD participants (but not HPs) were less random while worrying than thinking about a positive event during the key-pressing task, suggesting that worry consumed more attentional control resources in this population. During the N-Back task, GAD participants performed worse than HPs during the high load conditions only, indicating greater difficulty in sustaining focus on conditions requiring a higher degree of attentional control, even without concurrent task activity. Poor attentional control might underpin the difficulty of GAD individuals to stop worrying and switch to thinking more benign information. Further research could investigate whether worry consumes attentional control resources in other psychological disorders with high rates of worry (e.g., panic disorder, psychosis), as well as the extent to which attentional control is used by other forms of repetitive thinking, such as depressive rumination.},

Using growth curve modeling, we describe trajectories of cumulative risk and promotive factors and test the associations between the time-varying cumulative risk and promotive factor indices and violent behavior. Higher risk was associated with higher levels of violent behavior. Higher levels of promotive factors were associated with less violent behavior and moderated the association between risk and violent behaviors.

However, it is unknown whether the experience of positive emotion also broadens emotional information processing. Participants included 60 healthy undergraduate students who completed measures of psychopathology, self-reported emotional experience, and an emotional Stroop task designed to measure attentional bias to positive and negative emotional information. Results indicate significant associations between reaction times for high-intensity happiness words and self-reported high levels of positive emotion and low levels of negative emotions. These associations were not present for low intensity happiness words. Findings suggest that individuals who experience high levels of positive emotion and low levels of negative emotion demonstrate an attention bias for positive information and, from an information processing perspective, provide insight into the manner in which positive emotions broaden cognitive processes.},

However, little is known about the role of positive emotional processing in modulating anxiety reactivity to stress. In the current study, we used an attentional training paradigm designed to experimentally manipulate the processing of positive emotional cues. Participants were randomly assigned to complete a computerized probe detection task designed to induce selective processing of positive stimuli or to a sham condition. Following training, participants were exposed to a laboratory stressor (i.e., videotaped speech), and state anxiety and positive affect in response to the stressor were assessed. Results revealed that individual variability in the capacity to develop an attentional bias for positive information following training predicted subsequent emotional responses to the stressor. Moreover, individual differences in social anxiety, but not depression, moderated the effects of the attentional manipulation, such that, higher levels of social anxiety were associated with diminished attentional allocation toward positive cues. The current findings point to the potential value of considering the role of positive emotional processing in anxiety vulnerability.},

This study examined whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) promotes resilience in an aversive stimulus model of LH. All 55 participants were told that an undisclosed sequence of button presses would terminate an aversive stimulus on their forearm. In truth, only half had control (√æ C). The other half had no control ( √Ä C). All participants received real (R) or sham (S) left DLPFC rTMS during the paradigm ( √æC/R, √Ä C/S,√æ C/S, √Ä C/R). We evaluated the cognitive effects of LH using an anagram task. The LH paradigm successfully reduced perceived control in the √Ä C groups. As predicted, the √æC/R and √æ C/S groups tended to give up less quickly and take less time to solve each anagram than did the √Ä C/S group. Superior anagram performance in the √Ä C/R group approached statistical signiÔ¨Åcance. Our preliminary results suggest that manipulating the controllability of an aversive stimulus may induce an LH effect that manifests as impaired anagram performance. Further research is needed to reÔ¨Åne this model and determine if DLPFC rTMS mitigates any LH effects.},

Methods: Participants (N ¬º 251, 83.7\% female) showing elevated levels of RNT were randomly allocated to a 6-week cognitive-behavioral training delivered in a group, via the internet, or to a waitlist control condition. Self-report measures were collected at pre-intervention, post-intervention, 3 m and 12 m follow-up. Results: Both versions of the preventive intervention signiÔ¨Åcantly reduced RNT (d ¬º 0.53 to 0.89), and symptom levels of anxiety and depression (d ¬º 0.36 to 0.72). Effects were maintained until 12 m followup. The interventions resulted in a signiÔ¨Åcantly lower 12 m prevalence rate of depression (group intervention: 15.3\%, internet intervention: 14.7\%) and generalized anxiety disorder (group intervention: 18.0\%, internet intervention: 16.0\%), compared to the waitlist (32.4\% and 42.2\%, respectively). Mediation analyses demonstrated that reductions in RNT mediated the effect of the interventions on the prevalence of depression and generalized anxiety disorder. Conclusions: Results provide evidence for the efÔ¨Åcacy of this preventive intervention targeting RNT and support a selective prevention approach that speciÔ¨Åcally targets a known risk factor to prevent multiple disorders. ¬© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated whether this relaxation of attentional filters by positive affect reduces their selectivity for basic visual features. We induced positive, neutral, or negative affect and asked observers to identify a target motion direction in a series of rapid random moving dot displays. Using a reverse correlation method, we examined the differential effects of emotion on observers‚Äô perceptual tuning curves for motion direction. Here we find that positive affect reduces selectivity for motion direction by broadening observers‚Äô perceptual tuning relative to both neutral and negative affect conditions. These findings provide the first behavioral evidence that positive emotion influences selectivity for basic visual features through modulation of tuning properties.},

	abstract = {The complexities of deÔ¨Åning what appears to be the relatively simple concept of resilience are widely recognized. This paper analyses the concept of resilience from a range of disciplinary perspectives and clariÔ¨Åes a deÔ¨Ånition in order to inform research, policy and practice. The work takes a life course approach to resilience, examining evidence derived from research across the lifespan. It incorporates the methods of systematic review, concept analysis and consultation through face-to-face meetings. The synthesis of methodological approaches enables a clear identiÔ¨Åcation of the antecedents, deÔ¨Åning attributes and consequences of resilience, validated with stakeholder partners. Through this process, resilience is deÔ¨Åned as the process of effectively negotiating, adapting to, or managing signiÔ¨Åcant sources of stress or trauma. Assets and resources within the individual, their life and environment facilitate this capacity for adaptation and ‚Äòbouncing back‚Äô in the face of adversity. Across the life course, the experience of resilience will vary. A large proportion of resilience research is routed within the discipline of developmental psychology, and has mainly been developed with children and adolescents. A major contribution to resilience research could be made through more multi-disciplinary studies that examine the dynamics of resilience across the lifespan, its role in healthy ageing and in managing loss, such as changes in cognitive functioning.},

This paper systematically reviews the psychometric rigour of resilience measurement scales developed for use in general and clinical populations. Methods: Eight electronic abstract databases and the internet were searched and reference lists of all identified papers were hand searched. The focus was to identify peer reviewed journal articles where resilience was a key focus and/or is assessed. Two authors independently extracted data and performed a quality assessment of the scale psychometric properties. Results: Nineteen resilience measures were reviewed; four of these were refinements of the original measure. All the measures had some missing information regarding the psychometric properties. Overall, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, the Resilience Scale for Adults and the Brief Resilience Scale received the best psychometric ratings. The conceptual and theoretical adequacy of a number of the scales was questionable. Conclusion: We found no current ‚Äògold standard‚Äô amongst 15 measures of resilience. A number of the scales are in the early stages of development, and all require further validation work. Given increasing interest in resilience from major international funders, key policy makers and practice, researchers are urged to report relevant validation statistics when using the measures.},

Method: Telephone interviews of a representative sample of adults (N = 1933) collected information about sociodemographic variables, a standardised measure of psychological distress, and three brief existing scales to assess aspects of psychological well-being: Positive Relations with Others, Environmental Mastery, and Satisfaction with Life. The total of these three scales was also computed and explored as a measure of overall well-being. Results: Variables positively associated with psychological well-being were negatively associated with psychological distress and vice versa. For example low psychological well-being and high psychological distress were associated with being the only adult in the household, speaking a language other than English at home, being divorced or separated, having no educational qualifications beyond secondary school, being unable to work, having a low income, renting one‚Äôs accommodation, and receiving a pension. Conclusions: The measure of well-being shows psychometric promise for community surveys. Psychological well-being is not exactly the opposite end of the continuum to psychological distress, but more debate is needed about whether and when, research participants need to be asked questions about both.},

The purpose of this study was to investigate the distinct features of worry and rumination in factor structure and their predictive validity for the diagnosis of GAD and MDD. Methods: Four hundred and sixty-eight patients with GAD (n = 148) and MDD (n = 320) were enrolled and the diagnoses were conÔ¨Årmed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Participants completed the Penn State Worry Questionnaire and Ruminative Response Scale and the severity of anxiety and depressive symptoms was assessed via clinician ratings. Results: In joint factor analysis using the Penn State Worry Questionnaire and Ruminative Response Scale items, worry and rumination emerged as distinct factors. In logistic regression analyses, worry contributed to a higher probability of the diagnosis of GAD than rumination, as rumination did in MDD than worry. Conclusion: This is the Ô¨Årst comprehensive study investigating the diagnostic utility of worry and rumination in a well-deÔ¨Åned clinical sample of both GAD and MDD. Our results suggest that worry and rumination are distinct cognitive processes and play a differential role in the diagnosis of GAD and MDD, distinguishing them at the cognitive level.},

The current study was designed to explore if executive control, speciÔ¨Åcally task switching, can be trained in adolescents, what particular aspects of executive control may underlie training and transfer effects, and if acute bouts of exercise directly prior to cognitive training enhance training effects. For that purpose, a task switching training was employed that has been shown to be effective in other age groups. A group of adolescents (10‚Äì14 years, n = 20) that received a three-session task switching training was compared to a group (n = 20) that received the same task switching training but who exercised on a stationary bike before each training session. Additionally, a no-contact and an exercise only control group were included (both ns = 20). Analyses indicated that both training groups signiÔ¨Åcantly reduced their switching costs over the course of the training sessions for reaction times and error rates, respectively. Analyses indicated transfer to mixing costs in a task switching task that was similar to the one used in training. Far transfer was limited to a choice reaction time task and a tendency for faster reaction times in an updating task. Analyses revealed no additional effects of the exercise intervention. Findings thus indicate that executive control can be enhanced in adolescents through training and that updating may be of particular relevance for the effects of task switching training.},

	abstract = {Background. Many changes in social behavior take place during adolescence. Sexuality and romantic interests emerge during this time, and adolescents spend more time with peers and less time with parents and family. While such changes in social behavior have been well documented in the literature, relatively few neurophysiological explanations for these behavioral changes have been presented. Method. In this article we selectively review studies documenting (a) the neuronal circuits that are dedicated to the processing of social information ; (b) the changes in social behavior that take place during adolescence ; (c) developmental alterations in the adolescent brain ; and (d) links between the emergence of mood and anxiety disorders in adolescence and changes in brain physiology occurring at that time. Results. The convergence of evidence from this review indicates a relationship between development of brain physiology and developmental changes in social behavior. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the surge of gonadal steroids at puberty induces changes within the limbic system that alters the emotional attributions applied to social stimuli while the gradual maturation of the prefrontal cortex enables increasingly complex and controlled responses to social information. Conclusions. Observed alterations in adolescent social behavior reÔ¨Çect developmental changes in the brain social information processing network. We further speculate that dysregulation of the social information processing network in this critical period may contribute to the onset of mood and anxiety disorders during adolescence.},

	abstract = {Purpose: In clinical practice, it is often noted that some individuals struggle with chronic pain, while others find effective means to cope. The purpose of this study was to better understand how resilience fits into coping with persistent pain problems. Of interest was whether measures of resilience add to the prediction of adjustment to chronic pain over and above measures of pain coping as typically used with this patient group. Method: Individuals (N œ≠ 101) with chronic pain who attended an initial assessment at a pain clinic completed self-report measures of resilience and coping. Pain related outcome data were also collected. Results: Bivariate correlations indicated that higher resilience was associated with significantly less fear avoidance, less pain-related disability, and lower reported pain intensity. Consistent with theoretical propositions, bivariate analyses also indicated that more resilient individuals with chronic pain reported better social support, and were more likely to be working. Higher resilience was also positively correlated with greater pain self-efficacy. However, when hierarchical regression analyses were performed, resilience did not add significantly to the prediction of depression scores and disability scores, over and above the contribution made by existing measures of pain coping. Conclusion: These findings suggest that, although the construct of resilience appears to have important relationships with various dimensions of chronic pain, as currently operationalized, it does not add significantly to the understanding of chronic-pain adjustment. Rather than abandoning the resilience construct, our findings suggest that resilience as applied to the problem of chronic pain may require a refinement in measurement with this population.},

As hypothesized, the EEG gamma band was useful for differentiating worry from baseline and relaxation. During worry induction, GAD patients showed higher levels of gamma activity than control participants in posterior electrode sites that have been previously associated with negative emotion. Gamma fluctuations in these electrode sites were correlated with subjective emotional experience ratings lending additional support to interpretations of negative affect. Following 14 weeks of psychotherapy, the GAD group reported less negative affect with worry inductions and the corresponding gamma sites that previously differentiated the clinical from control groups changed for the GAD patients in the direction of control participants. These findings suggest converging evidence that patients suffering from GAD experience more negative emotion during worry and that the EEG gamma band is useful for monitoring fluctuations in pathological worry expected to follow successful treatment.},

We hypothesize that high WMC individuals are more likely to utilize proactive control yielding not only benefits, but also specific costs to performance. Across two separate, large-sample experiments, healthy young adults performed different variants of the AX-CPT context processing task, a well-established probe of proactive and reactive cognitive control. In two experiments, WMC predicted both improvements and relative impairments in task performance in a manner that was consistent with usage of proactive control.

	abstract = {Anxiety prepares an organism for dealing with threats by recruiting cognitive resources to process information about the threat, and by engaging physiological systems to prepare a response. Heightened trait anxiety is associated with biases in both these processes: high trait-anxious individuals tend to report heightened risk perceptions, and inappropriate engagement in danger mitigation behavior. However, no research has addressed whether the calibration between risk perception and danger mitigation behavior is affected by anxiety, though it is well recognized that this calibration is crucial for adaptive functioning. The current study aimed to examine whether anxiety is characterized by better or worse calibration of danger mitigation behavior to variations in risk magnitude. Low and high trait-anxious participants were presented with information about the likelihood and severity of a danger (loud noise burst) on each trial. Participants could decide to mitigate this danger by investing a virtual coin, at the cost of losing danger mitigation ability on subsequent trials. Importantly, level of risk likelihood and severity were varied independently, and the multiplicative relationship between the 2 defined total danger. Multilevel modeling showed that the magnitude of total danger predicted the probability of coin investments, over and above the effects of risk likelihood and severity, suggesting that participants calibrated their danger mitigation behavior to integrated risk information. Crucially, this calibration was affected by trait anxiety, indicating better calibration in high trait-anxious individuals. These results are discussed in light of existing knowledge and models of the effect of anxiety on risk perception and decision-making.},

	abstract = {Attentional bias modiÔ¨Åcation (ABM) is a promising therapeutic tool aimed at changing patterns of attentional selectivity associated with heightened anxiety. A number of studies have successfully implemented ABM using the modiÔ¨Åed dot-probe task. However others have not achieved the attentional change required to achieve emotional beneÔ¨Åts, highlighting the need for new ABM methods. The current study compared the effectiveness of a newly developed ABM task against the traditional dot-probe ABM task. The new person-identity-matching (PIM) task presented participants with virtual cards, each depicting a happy and angry person. The task encourages selective attention toward or away from threat by requiring participants to make matching judgements between two cards, based either on the identities of the happy faces, or of the angry faces. Change in attentional bias achieved by both ABM tasks was measured by a dot-probe assessment task. Their impact on emotional vulnerability was assessed by measuring negative emotional reactions to a video stressor. The PIM task succeeded in modifying attentional bias, and exerting an impact on emotional reactivity, whereas this was not the case for the dot-probe task. These results are considered in relation to the potential clinical utility of the current task in comparison to traditional ABM methodologies.},

	abstract = {Anxiety vulnerability is associated with an attentional bias to threat. When threat cues signal dangers that can be mitigated through behavioural action, vigilance for these threat cues can have an adaptive function. It is unknown, however, whether the anxiety-linked attentional bias is maintained or eliminated in contexts where threat cues signal dangers that can be mitigated. The current study used a probe task to assess anxiety-linked attentional bias to threat cues signalling a danger (noise burst) that in one condition could and in another condition could not be mitigated. Results showed that high trait anxious participants exhibited a larger attentional bias to threat than low trait anxious participants, and importantly, this anxiety-linked attentional bias did not differ as a function of danger mitigability. These findings suggest that anxiety-linked attentional bias is a rather pervasive processing style that may be insensitive to contextual variation in the adaptiveness of attending to threat.},

	abstract = {Objective: Heightened trait anxiety is associated with impaired behavioural preparedness for natural hazards. However, little is known about the mechanisms that contribute to this association. Research has shown that trait anxiety is associated with an attentional bias (AB) towards threat-relevant information, and some researchers have suggested that such vigilance could exacerbate the detrimental effect of trait anxiety on behavioural preparedness. Conversely, given the potentially adaptive role of AB in promoting engagement in danger mitigation behaviour, it is also possible that AB could ameliorate the negative association between anxiety and preparedness. The aim of this study was to discriminate the validity of these two hypotheses. Method: Participants were recruited from a bushÔ¨Åre-prone community in Western Australia and were assessed on measures of trait anxiety, AB to threat, and current bushÔ¨Åre preparedness. Results: As predicted, the results showed a negative correlation between trait anxiety and bushÔ¨Åre preparedness, and a positive correlation between trait anxiety and AB to bushÔ¨Åre-related threat. Furthermore, the negative relationship between trait anxiety and preparedness was moderated by this AB to bushÔ¨Åre-related threat, with the direction of this moderation showing that AB further exacerbated this negative relationship. Conclusions: This study is the Ô¨Årst to show that in a situation where people are exposed to a real-world danger that can be mitigated through appropriate engagement in speciÔ¨Åc preparatory behaviours, AB to danger-relevant threat serves to strengthen the observed negative association between trait anxiety and behavioural preparedness. Implications of these Ô¨Åndings are discussed.},

Elevated inÔ¨Çammation, a common risk factor across diseases of aging, may play a key role in the relationship between anxiety and physical disease. However, the neurobiological mechanisms linking anxiety with elevated inÔ¨Çammation remain unclear. In this review, we present a neurobiological model of the mechanisms by which anxiety promotes inÔ¨Çammation. SpeciÔ¨Åcally we propose that exaggerated neurobiological sensitivity to threat in anxious individuals may lead to sustained threat perception, which is accompanied by prolonged activation of threat-related neural circuitry and threat-responsive biological systems including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, autonomic nervous system (ANS), and inÔ¨Çammatory response. Over time, this pattern of responding can promote chronic inÔ¨Çammation through structural and functional brain changes, altered sensitivity of immune cell receptors, dysregulation of the HPA axis and ANS, and accelerated cellular aging. Chronic inÔ¨Çammation, in turn, increases risk for diseases of aging. Exaggerated neurobiological sensitivity to threat may thus be a treatment target for reducing disease risk in anxious individuals.},

Despite its fairly widespread use, little is known about the psychometric properties of the scale in adult samples. In the present study, factor structure of the ACS and its relationship with symptoms of anxiety and depression was investigated in a total sample of 728 Icelandic university students. Exploratory factor analysis in sample 1 (n = 361), yielded two factors, labeled focusing and shifting. ConÔ¨Årmatory factor analysis in sample 2 (n = 367) showed a reasonable Ô¨Åt of this two factor model. The two factors correlated strongly (0.73). The two subscales showed different predictive validity in a set of hierarchical regression analyses where the focusing subscale made a significant prediction of anxiety scores when depression scores were controlled for, and the shifting subscale signiÔ¨Åcant prediction of depression scores when anxiety scores were controlled for. These Ô¨Åndings are discussed in relation to previous studies on attentional and executive control in anxiety and depression. ¬© 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Whole systems of complementary and alternative medicine (WSCAM) emphasize positive emergent outcomes for the patient, for example, a sense of well-being. This paper presents a questionnaire-based study in healthy young adults for the purpose of exploring individual differences that contribute to the sense of well-being and to identify characteristics of Ô¨Çourishing versus nonÔ¨Çourishing individuals in terms of nonlinear dynamical systems concepts. Methods: Young adult college students (N œ≠ 856) completed questionnaires assessing global well-being (Arizona Integrative Outcomes Scale [AIOS]), global physical health, positive and negative mood (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule [PANAS]), resilience (Connor- Davidson Resilience Scale), and repressive defensiveness. Next, subjects were divided into Ô¨Çourisher/languisher groups by a previously determined ratio of positive/negative scores established by a study using complex systems methods. Results: Positive-to-negative affect (P:N) ratio accounted for more variance in AIOS (R2 œ≠ 0.19; P œΩ .001) than did separate positive or negative PANAS scores or physical health. Flourishers (14.5\% of the sample) were signiÔ¨Åcantly higher than languishers in defensiveness and resilience. Conclusions: Positive-to-negative affect explains a substantial portion of the variance in well-being of healthy young adults. The low percentage of Ô¨Çourishers in this nonclinical sample is consistent with previous population-based studies and suggests that Ô¨Çourishers are a minority, even in nonclinical settings. Positive-to-negative affect may be a useful variable for subsequent prospective studies of applied WSCAM treatments and in well and clinical populations. The well-being measure used in this study is easy to complete, sensitive, and may be a useful clinical measure to track change with treatment over time.},

However, it is unclear how such cognitive control deficits are modulated by task demands and by the emotionality of the distractors. A sample of 31 participants (25 female) completed a novel flanker task with emotional and neutral distractors under lowand high-cognitive-load conditions. The negative-going N2 event-related potential was measured to index participants‚Äô level of top-down resource allocation in the inhibition of distractors under high- and low-load conditions. Results showed N2 amplitudes were larger under high- compared with low-load conditions. In addition, under high but not low load, trait worry was associated with greater N2 amplitudes. Our findings support ACT predictions that trait worry adversely affects goal-directed behavior, and is associated with greater recruitment of cognitive resources to inhibit the impact of distracting information under conditions in which cognitive resources are taxed.},

The LRP has also been used to measure the preliminary activation of a response that is never actually produced. The LRP is a valuable measure of relatively central response activation that is now widely used in many areas of psychology involving reaction time tasks.

In a series of experiments, we explored the relationship between recognition of emotion in ambiguous facial expressions and aggressive thoughts and behavior, both in healthy adults and in adolescent youth at high risk of criminal offending and delinquency. We show that it is possible to experimentally modify biases in emotion recognition to encourage the perception of happiness over anger in ambiguous expressions. This change in perception results in a decrease in self-reported anger and aggression in healthy adults and high-risk youth, respectively, and also in independently rated aggressive behavior in high-risk youth. We obtained similar effects on mood using two different techniques to modify biases in emotion perception (feedback-based training and visual adaptation). These studies provide strong evidence that emotion processing plays a causal role in anger and the maintenance of aggressive behavior.},

One important unresolved question is whether disorder-congruent threats capture attention to a greater extent than do more general or disorder-incongruent threat stimuli. Evidence for attention bias speciÔ¨Åcity in anxiety would implicate involvement of previous learning and memory processes in threat-related attention bias, whereas lack of content speciÔ¨Åcity would point to perturbations in more generic attention processes. Enhanced clarity of mechanism could have clinical implications for the stimuli types used in Attention Bias ModiÔ¨Åcation Treatments (ABMT). Content speciÔ¨Åcity of threat-related attention bias in anxiety and potential moderators of this effect were investigated. A systematic search identiÔ¨Åed 37 samples from 29 articles (N = 866). Relevant data were extracted based on speciÔ¨Åc coding rules, and Cohen's d effect size was used to estimate bias speciÔ¨Åcity effects. The results indicate greater attention bias toward disorder-congruent relative to disorderincongruent threat stimuli (d = 0.28, p b 0.0001). This effect was not moderated by age, type of anxiety disorder, visual attention tasks, or type of disorder-incongruent stimuli. No evidence of publication bias was observed. Implications for threat bias in anxiety and ABMT are discussed.},

In these studies, a stable trajectory of positive health or resilience is almost always the modal outcome (Bonanno, 2004; Bonanno et al., 2011). Infurna and Luthar (2016, this issue) reported that they replicated findings from two early studies in which trajectories of subjective well-being were identified before and after divorce, widowhood, and unemployment (Galatzer-Levy, Bonanno, \& Mancini, 2010; Mancini, Bonanno, \& Clark, 2011) and then reanalyzed these data in such a way to conclude a decrease in the prevalence of resilience. In this commentary, we discuss three serious flaws in Infurna and Luthar‚Äôs claims. First, they did not actually replicate our original analyses. They used different data, time points, and parameters. Second, the model specifications in their reanalyses were not optimal because they increased variance, reduced variability in response to the stressor, and had lower entropy, indicating that their models more poorly captured unique patterns of response. Third, their reanalyses were theoretically uninformative as they minimized both group differences and overall responses to the stressor event and thus failed to identify widely acknowledged populations, such as chronic stress reactivity.},

	abstract = {Impairment in mental Ô¨Çexibility may be a key component contributing to cardinal cognitive symptoms among mood disorders patients, particularly thought control disorders. Impaired ability to switch from one thought to another might reÔ¨Çect difÔ¨Åculties in either generating new mental states, inhibiting previous states, or both. However, the neural underpinnings of impaired cognitive Ô¨Çexibility in mood disorders remain largely unresolved. We compared a group of mood disorders patients (n 5 29) and a group of matched healthy subjects (n 5 32) on a novel task-switching paradigm involving happy and sad faces, that allowed us to separate generation of a new mental set (Switch Cost) and inhibition of the previous set during switching (Inhibition Cost), using fMRI. Behavioral data showed a larger Switch Cost in patients relative to controls, but the average Inhibition Cost did not differ between groups. At the neural level, a main effect of group was found with stronger activation of the subgenual cingulate cortex in patients. The larger Switch Cost in patients was reÔ¨Çected by a stronger recruitment of brain regions involved in attention and executive control, including the left intraparietal sulcus, precuneus, left inferior fontal gyrus, and right anterior cingulate. Critically, activity in the subgenual cingulate cortex was not downregulated by inhibition in patients relative to controls. In conclusion, mood disorder patients have exaggerated Switch Cost relative to controls, and this deÔ¨Åcit in cognitive Ô¨Çexibility is associated with increased activation of the fronto-parietal attention networks, combined with impaired modulation of the subgenual cingulate cortex when inhibition of previous mental states is needed.

Although data consistently show it is associated with self-reported negative cognitive styles, less is known about the mechanisms underlying this relationship. Cognitive biases in attention, interpretation and memory represent plausible mechanisms and are known to characterise adult depression. We provide the Ô¨Årst structured review of studies investigating the nature and causal role of cognitive biases in youth depression. Key questions are (i) do cognitive biases characterise youth depression? (ii) are cognitive biases a vulnerability factor for youth depression? and (iii) do cognitive biases play a causal role in youth depression? We Ô¨Ånd consistent evidence for positive associations between attention and interpretation biases and youth depression. Stronger biases in youth with an elevated risk of depression support cognitive-vulnerability models. Preliminary evidence from cognitive bias modiÔ¨Åcation paradigms supports a causal role of attention and interpretation biases in youth depression but these paradigms require testing in clinical samples before they can be considered treatment tools. Studies of memory biases in youth samples have produced mixed Ô¨Åndings and none have investigated the causal role of memory bias.

	abstract = {The notion that some people are more vulnerable to adversity as a function of inherent risk characteristics is widely embraced in most fields of psychology. This is reflected in the popularity of the diathesis-stress framework, which has received a vast amount of empirical support over the years. Much less effort has been directed toward the investigation of endogenous factors associated with variability in response to positive influences. One reason for the failure to investigate individual differences in response to positive experiences as a function of endogenous factors may be the absence of adequate theoretical frameworks. According to the differential-susceptibility hypothesis, individuals generally vary in their developmental plasticity regardless of whether they are exposed to negative or positive influences‚Äîa notion derived from evolutionary reasoning. On the basis of this now well-supported proposition, we advance herein the new concept of vantage sensitivity, reflecting variation in response to exclusively positive experiences as a function of individual endogenous characteristics. After distinguishing vantage sensitivity from theoretically related concepts of differential-susceptibility and resilience, we review some recent empirical evidence for vantage sensitivity featuring behavioral, physiological, and genetic factors as moderators of a wide range of positive experiences ranging from family environment and psychotherapy to educational intervention. Thereafter, we discuss genetic and environmental factors contributing to individual differences in vantage sensitivity, potential mechanisms underlying vantage sensitivity, and practical implications.},

However, such ‚Äúrisk‚Äù variants are surprisingly frequent in the population. Evolutionary analysis suggests that genetic variants associated with increased risk for maladaptive development under adverse environmental conditions are maintained in the population because they are also associated with advantages in response to different contextual conditions. These advantages may include (a) coexisting genetic resilience pertaining to other adverse inÔ¨Çuences, (b) a general genetic susceptibility to both low and high environmental quality, and (c) a coexisting propensity to beneÔ¨Åt disproportionately from positive and supportive exposures, as reÔ¨Çected in the recent framework of vantage sensitivity.

After a brief conceptual introduction, we first discuss challenges to network theory: (1) What is the validity of the network approach beyond some commonly investigated disorders such as major depression? (2) How do we best define psychopathological networks and their constituent elements? (3) And how can we gain a better understanding of the causal nature and real-life underpinnings of associations among symptoms? Next, after a short technical introduction to network modeling, we discuss challenges to network methodology: (4) Heterogeneity of samples studied with network analytic models; and (5) a lurking replicability crisis in this strongly data-driven and exploratory field. Addressing these challenges may propel the network approach from its adolescence into adulthood, and promises advances in understanding psychopathology both at the nomothetic and idiographic level.},

	abstract = {The dot-probe task has been widely used in research to produce an index of biased attention based on reaction times (RTs). Despite its popularity, very few published studies have examined psychometric properties of the task, including test-retest reliability, and no previous study has examined reliability in clinically anxious samples or systematically explored the effects of task design and analysis decisions on reliability. In the current analysis, we utilized dot-probe data from three studies where attention bias towards threat-related faces was assessed at multiple (‚â•5) timepoints. Two of the studies were similar (adults with Social Anxiety Disorder, similar design features) while one was much more disparate (pediatric healthy volunteers, distinct task design). We explored the effects of analysis choices (e.g., bias score calculation formula, methods for outlier handling) on reliability and searched for convergence of findings across the three studies. We found that, when considering the three studies concurrently, the most reliable RT bias index utilized data from dot-bottom trials, comparing congruent to incongruent trials, with rescaled outliers, particularly after averaging across more than one assessment point. Although reliability of RT bias indices was moderate to low under most circumstances, within-session variability in bias (attention bias variability; ABV), a recently proposed RT index, was more reliable across sessions. Several eyetracking-based indices of attention bias (available in the pediatric healthy sample only) showed reliability that matched the optimal RT index (ABV). On the basis of these findings, we make specific recommendations to researchers using the dot probe, particularly those wishing to investigate individual differences and/or single-patient applications.},

There are a number of tools available to measure wellness, each with its own focus, depending on the definition or model from which it was developed.

	abstract = {Given the many benefits conferred by trait happiness and life satisfaction, a primary goal is to determine how these traits relate to underlying cognitive processes. For example, visual attention acts as a gateway to awareness, raising the question of whether happy and satisfied people attend to (and therefore see) the world differently. Previous work suggests that biases in selective attention are associated with both trait negativity and with positive affect states, but to our knowledge, no previous work has explored whether trait-happy individuals attend to the world differently. Here, we employed eye tracking as a continuous measure of sustained overt attention during passive viewing of displays containing positive and neutral photographs to determine whether selective attention to positive scenes is associated with measures of trait happiness and life satisfaction. Both trait measures were significantly correlated with selective attention for positive (vs. neutral) scenes, and this general pattern was robust across several types of positive stimuli (achievement, social, and primary reward), and not because of positive or negative state affect. Such effects were especially prominent during the later phases of sustained viewing. This suggests that people who are happy and satisfied with life may literally see the world in a more positive light, as if through rose-colored glasses. Future work should investigate the causal relationship between such attention biases and one‚Äôs happiness and life satisfaction.},

For that reason, the reliability of a dependent variable is a function of the ratio of true-score variance and observed-score variance, whereas statistical power is a function of the sum of the same two variances. Controversies about how reliability is related to statistical power often can be explained by authors‚Äô use of the term ‚Äúreliability‚Äù in a general way to mean ‚Äúconsistency,‚Äù ‚Äúprecision,‚Äù or ‚Äúdependability,‚Äù which does not always correspond to its mathematical definition as a variance ratio.

To overcome these limitations, the present cross-cultural multisite study estimated regularized partial correlation networks of 16 PTSD symptoms across four data sets of traumatized patients receiving treatment for PTSD (total N = 2,782). Despite differences in culture, trauma type, and severity of the samples, considerable similarities emerged, with moderate to high correlations between symptom profiles (0.43‚Äì0.82), network structures (0.62‚Äì0.74), and centrality estimates (0.63‚Äì0.75).

The current paper draws on theoretical frameworks and key empirical studies to outline the distinctive attentional processes highlighted as being important in understanding anxiety. We develop a conceptual framework to make a distinction between two attentional biases: selective attention to threat and hypervigilance for threat. We suggest that these biases each have a different purpose and can account for the typical patterns of facilitated and impaired attention evident in anxious individuals. The framework is novel in its speciÔ¨Åcation of the eye movement behavior associated with these attentional biases. We highlight that selective attention involves narrowing overt attention onto threat to ensure that these stimuli receive processing priority, leading to rapid engagement with task-relevant threat and delayed disengagement from task-irrelevant threat. We show that hypervigilance operates in the presence and absence of threat and involves monitoring for potential dangers via attentional broadening or excessive scanning of the environment with numerous eye movements, leading to improved threat detection and increased distraction from task-irrelevant threat. We conclude that future research could usefully employ eye movement measures to more clearly understand the diverse roles of attention in anxiety.},

	abstract = {Persistent complex bereavement disorder (PCBD) is a bereavement-specific syndrome characterized by prolonged and impairing grief. Most research on this syndrome rests on the traditional latent variable model whereby symptoms reflect an underlying entity. The network (or causal system) approach offers an alternative framework for understanding PCBD that does not suffer from limitations inherent in the latent entity approach. The network approach to psychopathology conceptualizes the relation between symptoms and disorder as mereological, not reflective. That is, symptoms do not reflect an inferred, unobservable category or dimension, but rather are themselves constitutive of the disorder. Accordingly, we propose that PCBD constitutes a causal system of mutually reinforcing symptoms that arise following the death of a loved one and settle into a pathological equilibrium. In this study, we used data from the Changing Lives of Older Couples (CLOC) database to identify symptoms central to PCBD, distinguish the PCBD network from an overlapping but distinct network of depression symptoms, and examine how previously identified risk factors may contribute to the maintenance or development of PCBD. Together, these findings provide an important first step toward understanding the nature and etiology of the PCBD network.},

In two experiments using a flanker task, we found that distractor interference of stimuli signaling opportunities or dangers was stronger after inducing an outcome focus of the opposite valence. The second experiment provided additional evidence that the incongruency effect reflects a global shift in affective attentional biases and is not mediated by changes in strategies or in the perceived valence of the stimuli. It is argued that counter-regulation in affective attentional biases serves an important function for the regulation of emotion and action.},

Method: Electronic and manual literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and PSYCHINFO, using a range of search terms around biological and psychological factors inÔ¨Çuencing resilience as observed in human and experimental animal studies, complemented by review articles and cross-references. Results: The term resilience is used in the literature for diÔ¨Äerent phenomena ranging from prevention of mental health disturbance to successful adaptation and swift recovery after experiencing life adversities, and may also include post-traumatic psychological growth. Secure attachment, experiencing positive emotions and having a purpose in life are three important psychological building blocks of resilience. Overlap between psychological and biological Ô¨Åndings on resilience in the literature is most apparent for the topic of stress sensitivity, although recent results suggest a crucial role for reward experience in resilience. Conclusion: Improving the understanding of the links between genetic endowment, environmental impact and gene‚Äìenvironment interactions with developmental psychology and biology is crucial for elucidating the neurobiological and psychological underpinnings of resilience.},

Resilience is an inference based on evidence that some individuals have a better outcome than others who have experienced a comparable level of adversity; moreover, the negative experience may have either a sensitizing effect or a strengthening ‚Äústeeling‚Äù effect in relation to the response to later stress or adversity. After noting the crucial importance of first testing for the environmental mediation of risk through ‚Äúnatural experiments,‚Äù findings are reviewed on ‚Äústeeling effects‚Äù in animal models and humans. Gene‚Äìenvironment interaction findings are considered, and it is noted that there is some evidence that the genetic influences concerns responsivity to all environments and not just bad ones. Life course effects are reviewed in relation to evidence on turning point effects associated with experiences that increase opportunities and enhance coping.

This suggests that anxiety can be clinically treated by directly targeting this interpretive bias. The present study was designed to modify a negative interpretive bias in highly anxious individuals, and subsequently assess the hypothesized beneÔ¨Åcial effects on clinical measures. High trait-anxious participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: a positive interpretational Cognitive Bias ModiÔ¨Åcation (CBM-I) or a control condition (n = 2 √Ç 17). The program was offered online for eight consecutive days. Upon completing the program, participants who had followed positive CBM-I were less state and trait-anxious compared to the control group. Additionally, positively trained participants scored lower on a measure of general psychopathology (SCL-90). No effects were observed on social anxiety and stress vulnerability. The mixed pattern of Ô¨Åndings renders them rather inconclusive, leaving interpretations of the potential therapeutic merits of CBM-I open for future research.},

We also include scales developed or adapted for children and adolescents. In the extant literature, measures of repetitive thinking generally show small-to-moderate correlations with measures of psychopathology. This review highlights problems with the content validity of existing instruments; for example, confounds between repetitive thought and symptomatology, metacognitive beliefs, and affect. This review also builds on previous reviews by including newer transdiagnostic measures of repetitive thinking. We hope that this review will help to expand our understanding of repetitive thinking beyond the mood and anxiety disorders, and suggest ways forward in the measurement of repetitive thinking in individuals with comorbid conditions.},

Faces were selected from the Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces (KDEF) database (Lundqvist, Flykt, \& √ñhman, 1998). In the positive MIP condition, analyses revealed a mood-congruent relation between positive mood and greater attentional deployment to happy faces. In the negative MIP condition, however, analyses revealed a mood-incongruent relation between increased negative mood and greater attentional deployment to happy faces. Furthermore, attentional deployment to happy faces after the negative MIP predicted participants‚Äô mood recovery at the end of the experimental session.

A neurodevelopmental perspective on mindfulness has been advocated as a powerful tool to enhance our understanding of underlying neurocognitive changes that have implications for developmental well-being research and the implementation of mindfulness in education. To stimulate more research in the developmental cognitive neuroscience of mindfulness, this article outlines possible indexes of mindfulness-based change in adolescence, with a focus on event-related brain potential (ERP) markers. We provide methodological recommendations for future studies and offer examples of research paradigms. We also discuss how mindfulness practice could impact on the development of prefrontal brain structures and enhance attention control and emotion regulation skills in adolescents, impacting in turn on their self-regulation and coping skills. We highlight advantages of the ERP methodology in neurodevelopmental research of mindfulness. It is proposed that research using established experimental tasks targeting ERP components such as the contingent negative variability, N200, error-related negativity and error positivity, P300, and late positive potential could elucidate developmentally salient shifts in the neural plasticity of the adolescent brain induced by mindfulness practice.},

The studies have important relations between humor and positive emotion as well as a significant improvement in signs and symptoms of depression using differents strategies of positive psychology. Another relevant aspect is the preventative character of the proposed interventions by positive psychology by the fact that increase well-being and produce elements such as resilience and coping resources that reduce the recurrent relapses in the treatment of depression. The strategies of positive psychology, such as increasing positive emotions, develop personal strengths: seeking direction, meaning and engagement for the day-to-day life of the patients, appear as potentially tools for the prophylaxis and treatment of depression, helping to reduce signs and symptoms as well as for prevention of relapses.},

Here, we examined the beneficial effects of working memory training on attentional control in pre-selected high trait anxious individuals who underwent a three week daily training intervention using the adaptive dual n-back task. Pre and post outcome measures of attentional control were assessed using a Flanker task that included a stress induction and an emotional Antisaccade task (with angry and neutral faces as target). Resting state EEG (Theta/Beta ratio) was recorded to as a neural marker of trait attentional control. Our results showed that adaptive working memory training improved attentional control with transfer effects on the Flanker task and resting state EEG, but effects of training on the Antisaccade task were less conclusive.},

	abstract = {According to the attentional control theory, worry, a crucial component of anxiety, impairs task performance through its direct effect on working memory capacity (WMC) by using up the limited resources available for performance thus reducing attentional control. We tested this hypothesis in the current study by examining the causal inÔ¨Çuence of active worrying on WMC in a sample of undergraduate university students (n = 64) assigned either to a worry condition or to a non-worry control condition. Participants performed a change detection task before and after the worry/control manipulation. Mediation analyses showed that the level of self-reported worry mediated the effects of condition on change in WMC as demonstrated by the signiÔ¨Åcant indirect effect of worry and the resulting nonsigniÔ¨Åcant direct effect of condition on change in WMC. Similar results were obtained when using state anxiety measures as mediating factors. Results of the current study are amongst the Ô¨Årst to demonstrate that worry impairs WMC and as such have important implications for understanding the impact of worry.},

	abstract = {Background and objectives: Attentional processes have been suggested to play a crucial role in resilience deÔ¨Åned as positive adaptation facing adversity. However, research is lacking on associations between attentional biases to positive and threat-related stimuli, attentional control and trait resilience. Methods: Data stem from the follow-up assessment of a longitudinal study investigating mental health and related factors among German soldiers. Trait resilience was assessed with the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale and attentional control with the Attentional Control Scale. A subset of n ¬º 198 soldiers also completed a dot probe task with happy, neutral and threatening faces. Results: Attentional control was positively related to trait resilience. Results revealed no associations between both attentional biases and trait resilience. However, there was a negative association between attentional bias to threat and trait resilience when attentional control was low and a positive association between attentional bias to threat and trait resilience when attentional control was high. No such associations were found for attentional bias to positive stimuli. Limitations: Generalizability to other populations may be limited since we exclusively focused on male soldiers. Also, the cross-sectional design does not allow for causal conclusions. Conclusions: Findings suggest that attentional processing may promote trait resilience. Future research on preventive interventions should consider these Ô¨Åndings. ¬© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Patients were randomly assigned to either an attention training condition (n œ≠ 18), in which patients completed a modified dot-probe task designed to facilitate attentional disengagement from disgusted faces, or a control dot-probe task condition (n œ≠ 18). As predicted, patients in the attention training condition exhibited significantly greater reductions in social anxiety and trait anxiety, compared with patients in the control condition. At termination, 72\% of patients in the active treatment condition, relative to 11\% of patients in the control condition, no longer met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.) criteria for SAD. At 4-month follow-up, patients in the attention training condition continued to maintain their clinical improvement, and diagnostic differences across conditions were also maintained.

In the present study we investigated whether a stimulus associated with a threat of electrical shock attracts attention and accordingly interferes with the execution of voluntary eye movements to other locations. In 2 experiments, we showed that when a fear-conditioned and a neutral stimulus were presented simultaneously, voluntary saccades were initiated faster toward fear-conditioned compared with neutral stimuli. Moreover, saccades often erroneously went to the location of threat even when a saccade to a different location was required. This implies an automatic shift of attention to a fear-conditioned stimulus that interferes with saccade execution. The same pattern of results was found for a neutral stimulus that was always presented together with the fear-conditioned stimulus and consequently itself became associated with threat. The current results indicate that threatening stimuli attract visual attention and subsequently bias saccade target selection in a reflexive fashion.},

In such a view, a construct like ‚Äôdepression‚Äô is not seen as a latent variable that underlies symptoms like ‚Äôlack of sleep‚Äô or ‚Äôfatigue‚Äô, and neither as a composite constructed out of these symptoms, but as a system of causal relations between the symptoms themselves (e.g., lack of sleep / fatigue, etc.).

The current study utilized eye-movement data to examine the time-course of visual attention over 1500 ms trials of a probe detection task. Nineteen participants with a primary diagnosis of social phobia based on DSM-IV criteria and 20 non-clinical controls completed this task with angry, fearful, and happy face trials. Overt visual attention to the emotional and neutral faces was measured in 50 ms segments across the trial. Over time, participants with social phobia attend less to emotional faces and speciÔ¨Åcally less to happy faces compared to controls. Further, attention to emotional relative to neutral expressions did not vary notably by emotion for participants with social phobia, but control participants showed a pattern after 1000 ms in which over time they preferentially attended to happy expressions and avoided negative expressions. Findings highlight the importance of considering attention biases to positive stimuli as well as the pattern of attention between groups. These results suggest that attention ‚Äúbias‚Äù in social phobia may be driven by a relative lack of the biases seen in non-anxious participants.},

Findings revealed that signals of threat seem to interfere with already processed information in individuals suffering from PTSD.

Forty-five participants received WM training using either emotional or neutral material, or an undemanding control task. WM training, regardless of training material, led to transfer gains on another WM task and in fluid intelligence. However, only brain-training with emotional material yielded transferable gains to improved control over affective information on an emotional Stroop task. The data support the reality of transferable benefits of demanding WM training and suggest that transferable gains across to affective contexts require training with material congruent to those contexts. These findings constitute preliminary evidence that intensive cognitively demanding brain-training can improve not only our abstract problem-solving capacity, but also ameliorate cognitive control processes (e.g. decision-making) in our daily emotive environments.},

	abstract = {Appraisal theories of emotion hold that it is the way a person interprets a situation‚Äîrather than the situation itself‚Äîthat gives rise to one emotion rather than another emotion (or no emotion at all). Unfortunately, most prior tests of this foundational hypothesis have simultaneously varied situations and appraisals, making an evaluation of this assumption difficult. In the present study, participants responded to a standardized laboratory situation with a variety of different emotions. Appraisals predicted the intensity of individual emotions across participants. In addition, subgroups of participants with similar emotional response profiles made comparable appraisals. Together, these findings suggest that appraisals may be necessary and sufficient to determine different emotional reactions toward a particular situation.},

	abstract = {Widely documented inverse associations between socioeconomic standing and incident chronic disease and mortality invite explanation in terms of pathways to these outcomes. Empirical identification of pathways, or histories, requires measures that assess cumulative wear and tear on physiological systems following from psychosocial adversity and genetic predispositions. Such an assessment, allostatic load, has been shown to predict later life mortality, incident cardiovascular disease, and decline in physical and cognitive functioning. Using data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS), we seek precursors to allostatic load via ordered categories of cumulative adversity relative to advantage over the life course. We operationalize these histories via unfolding economic circumstances and social relationship experiences (e.g., parent‚Äìchild interactions, quality of spousal ties). Findings reveal a strong direct association between the extent of adversity relative to advantage in an ordering of these histories and likelihood of high allostatic load. Importantly, resilient individuals with economic disadvantage, but compensating positive social relationship histories also show low prevalence of high allostatic load.},

Previous resilience measures assess resources that may promote resilience rather than recovery, resistance, adaptation, or thriving. Purpose: To test a new brief resilience scale. Method: The brief resilience scale (BRS) was created to assess the ability to bounce back or recover from stress. Its psychometric characteristics were examined in four samples, including two student samples and samples with cardiac and chronic pain patients. Results: The BRS was reliable and measured as a unitary construct. It was predictably related to personal characteristics, social relations, coping, and health in all samples. It was negatively related to anxiety, depression, negative affect, and physical symptoms when other resilience measures and optimism, social support, and Type D personality (high negative affect and high social inhibition) were controlled. There were large differences in BRS scores between cardiac patients with and without Type D and women with and without Ô¨Åbromyalgia. Conclusion: The BRS is a reliable means of assessing resilience as the ability to bounce back or recover from stress and may provide unique and important information about people coping with health-related stressors.},

	abstract = {Background: Optimal psychological development is dependent upon a complex interplay between individual and situational factors. Investigating the development of these factors in adolescence will help to improve understanding of emotional vulnerability and resilience. The CogBIAS longitudinal study (CogBIAS-L-S) aims to combine cognitive and genetic approaches to investigate risk and protective factors associated with the development of mood and impulsivity-related outcomes in an adolescent sample. Methods: CogBIAS-L-S is a three-wave longitudinal study of typically developing adolescents conducted over 4 years, with data collection at age 12, 14 and 16. At each wave participants will undergo multiple assessments including a range of selective cognitive processing tasks (e.g. attention bias, interpretation bias, memory bias) and psychological self-report measures (e.g. anxiety, depression, resilience). Saliva samples will also be collected at the baseline assessment for genetic analyses. Multilevel statistical analyses will be performed to investigate the developmental trajectory of cognitive biases on psychological functioning, as well as the influence of genetic moderation on these relationships. Discussion: CogBIAS-L-S represents the first longitudinal study to assess multiple cognitive biases across adolescent development and the largest study of its kind to collect genetic data. It therefore provides a unique opportunity to understand how genes and the environment influence the development and maintenance of cognitive biases and provide insight into risk and protective factors that may be key targets for intervention.},

The paradigm requires simultaneous performance of a visuospatial search and a verbal storage task. These tasks are performed in the presence of either neutral or negative emotional distractor images. Experiments 1 and 2 confirmed our prediction that WMC would be reduced in the context of emotional compared with neutral distractors in student and community samples. Experiment 3 extended these findings to a clinical sample. WMC in motor vehicle accident survivors with a history of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was selectively reduced in the presence of trauma-related emotional distraction compared with survivors without a history of PTSD. Implications of these findings for affective cognitive science are discussed.},

Being able to specify the smallest effect size that is considered practically meaningful facilitates the design of well-powered experiments and enables researchers to falsify predictions by rejecting effects larger than this effect size. We illustrate two methods used in clinical research to determine the minimally detectable difference: the smallest effect size that is associated with a subjectively noticeable change at the individual level. These anchor-based methods provide one possible approach for researchers to determine their smallest effect size of interest, and to interpret the effect size estimates observed in research lines. We discuss the limitations of applying anchor-based methods in psychology, and point out there is ample room for statistical and methodological improvement, but also highlight the potential for anchor-based methods to provide one approach to establish a smallest effect of interest in lines of research.},

Although it is known that emotion regulation strategies, such as cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression, may have divergent consequences for emotional responses, the cognitive processes underlying these differences remain unclear. Here we used eye-tracking to investigate the role of attentional deployment in emotion regulation success. We hypothesized that differences in the deployment of attention to emotional areas of complex visual scenes may be a contributing factor to the differential effects of these two strategies on emotional experience. Eye-movements, pupil size, and self-reported negative emotional experience were measured while healthy young adult participants viewed negative IAPS images and regulated their emotional responses using either cognitive reappraisal or expressive suppression. Consistent with prior work, reappraisers reported feeling significantly less negative than suppressers when regulating emotion as compared to a baseline condition. Across both groups, participants looked away from emotional areas during emotion regulation, an effect that was more pronounced for suppressers. Critically, irrespective of emotion regulation strategy, participants who looked toward emotional areas of a complex visual scene were more likely to experience emotion regulation success. Taken together, these results demonstrate that attentional deployment varies across emotion regulation strategies and that successful emotion regulation depends on the extent to which people look toward emotional content in complex visual scenes.},

Estimating statistical models where a subset of the data is selected based on a function of the analyzed variables introduces Berkson‚Äôs bias, which presents a potential threat to the validity of findings in the clinical literature. The aim of the present paper is to investigate the effect of Berkson‚Äôs bias on the performance of the two most commonly used psychological network models, the Gaussian Graphical Model (GGM) for continuous and ordinal data, and the Ising Model for binary data. In two simulation studies, we test how well the models perform in recovering the true network when estimation is based on a subset of the data typically seen in clinical studies. The selection of data varies with respect to sample size and the cut-off sum-score of the analyzed variables. Recovery performance is established via three metrics: correlation, sensitivity, and specificity. In addition, the density and the amount of spurious negative edges are measured. Simulation parameters are based on a large clinical dataset of depressed patients. Results of both studies indicate that higher cut-off sum-score values are associated with lower performance on all metrics and more spurious negative edges. Our findings provide evidence that Berkson‚Äôs bias is a considerable and underappreciated problem in the clinical network literature.},

Coping and emotion regulation theorists have proposed dynamic models in which these two factors, the person and the situation, interact over time to inform adaptation. In practice, however, researchers have tended to assume that particular regulatory strategies are consistently beneficial or maladaptive. We label this assumption the fallacy of uniform efficacy and contrast it with findings from a number of related literatures that have suggested the emergence of a broader but as yet poorly defined construct that we refer to as regulatory flexibility. In this review, we articulate this broader construct and define both its features and limitations. Specifically, we propose a heuristic individual differences framework and review research on three sequential components of flexibility for which propensities and abilities vary: sensitivity to context, availability of a diverse repertoire of regulatory strategies, and responsiveness to feedback. We consider the methodological limitations of research on each component, review questions that future research on flexibility might address, and consider how the components might relate to each other and to broader conceptualizations about stability and change across persons and situations.},

	abstract = {Theories about coping with potential trauma have emphasized the importance of concerted focus on processing the traumatic event. However, empirical evidence also suggests that it may be salubrious to distract oneself, remain optimistic, and focus on moving past the event. These seemingly contradictory perspectives are integrated in the concept of coping flexibility. This investigation reports the development and validation of a brief questionnaire, the Perceived Ability to Cope With Trauma (PACT) scale, with 2 scales that measure the perceived ability to focus on processing the trauma (trauma focus) and to focus on moving beyond the trauma (forward focus). In addition, we created a single flexibility score that represented the ability to use both types of coping. Participants included an Israeli sample with potential high trauma exposure and a sample of American college students. The factor structure of the PACT was confirmed in both samples. Preliminary evidence was obtained for the PACT‚Äôs convergent, discriminant, and incremental validity. Both the Forward Focus and Trauma Focus scales were independently associated with better adjustment, and each scale independently moderated the impact of heightened trauma exposure. Similarly, the combination of these scales into a single parsimonious flexibility score also moderated trauma exposure. Limitations of and future research with the measure are considered.},

	abstract = {The ability to accurately perceive cues to contextual demands across different situations has been identified as a crucial component of successful self-regulation. However, previous attempts to measure context sensitivity have suffered from serious methodological limitations, most notably the possibility that respondents may not possess sufficient knowledge of their own abilities, the confounding of perception of context with response to context, the use of only one or two contextual variations, and the failure to consider the abilities to both accurately detect contextual cues and accurately determine cue absence. This article reports a new, easy-to-administer scenario-based questionnaire measure, the Context Sensitivity Index (CSI), that addressed each of these limitations. The 20-item CSI was iteratively developed and normed using data from five studies to create separate indices to capture sensitivity to the presence of contextual cues (Cue Presence index) and to the relative absence of cues (Cue Absence index). We validated these indices against measures of flexibility, psychopathology, and other scales. Results are discussed in terms of the CSI‚Äôs implications, limitations, and future applications.},

In this network approach, psychological constructs are represented as complex systems of interacting components. In addition to insightful visualization of dynamics, a network perspective leads to a new way of thinking about the nature of psychological phenomena by offering new tools for studying dynamical processes in psychology. In this article, we explain the rationale of the network approach, the associated methods and visualization, and illustrate it using an empirical example focusing on the relation between the daily fluctuations of emotions and neuroticism. The results suggest that individuals with high levels of neuroticism had a denser emotion network compared with their less neurotic peers. This effect is especially pronounced for the negative emotion network, which is in line with previous studies that found a denser network in depressed subjects than in healthy subjects. In sum, we show how the network approach may offer new tools for studying dynamical processes in psychology.},

The reliability of this anxiety-linked attentional bias has become the focus of considerable recent interest. We distinguish between the potential inconsistency of anxiety-linked attentional bias and inconsistency potentially reflecting the psychometric properties of the assessment approaches used to measure it. Though groups with heightened anxiety vulnerability often exhibit, on average, elevated attention to threat, the evidence suggests that individuals are unlikely to each display a stable, invariant attentional bias to threat. Moreover, although existing assessment approaches can differentiate between groups, they do not exhibit the internal consistency or test-retest reliability necessary to classify individuals in terms of their characteristic pattern of attentional responding to threat. We discuss the appropriate uses of existing attentional bias assessment tasks and propose strategies for enhancing classification of individuals in terms of their tendency to display an attentional bias to threat.},

ERP analyses comparing children who switched Ô¨Çexibly (passed) to those who perseverated on post-switch trials (failed) focused on the N2 component, which was maximal over fronto-central sites. N2 amplitude was smaller (less negative) for children who passed the DCCS than for children who failed, suggesting that the N2, often associated with conÔ¨Çict monitoring, may serve as a neural marker of individual differences in executive function.

	doi = {10.31219/osf.io/8xgkb},
	abstract = {Background: Childhood adversity (CA), such as trauma or long-lasting stress, is strongly associated with mental health problems. Resilience factors (RFs) reduce the liability for mental health problems subsequent to CA. As mental health levels change over time, RFs may also change. Yet, knowledge on the latter is scarce. Therefore, we examined whether RF mean levels, RF interrelations, and RF pathways to distress change between early (age 14) and later adolescence (age 17). Methods: We studied 10 empirically-supported RFs in adolescents with (CA+; n=638) and without CA (CA-; n=501). RF interrelations and RF-distress pathways were modelled using regularized partial correlation networks. Results: The CA+ group had lower RFs and higher distress at both ages. All inter-personal RFs (e.g. friendships) showed stable mean levels between age 14 and 17, whereas five of seven intra-personal RFs (e.g. distress-tolerance) changed. All RF level changes were similar for adolescents with and without CA. Regarding RF interrelations we found that at age 14, but not at age 17, the RF network of the CA+ group was less positively connected, suggesting that the RFs are less likely to enhance each other than in the CA- group. Many negative direct pathways emerged between RFs and distress. Over time, the number of these pathways decreased from seven to five in the CA+, but increased from three to five in the CA- network. In the CA+ group these pathways may be less advantageous, as lower RFs are less likely to decrease higher distress. Conclusion: Persistent lower RFs, higher distress, and potentially disadvantaged RF-distress pathways suggest that RFs in the CA+ group offer less protection against mental health problems. These findings may explain why exposure to CA has strong proximal effects, and is often found to have a lasting impact on mental health.},

A key assumption of the GGM is that each pairwise interaction is independent of the values of all other variables. However, in psychological research this is often implausible. In this paper, we extend the GGM by allowing each pairwise interaction between two variables to be moderated by (a subset of) all other variables in the model, and thereby introduce a Moderated Network Model (MNM). We show how to construct the MNW and propose an 1-regularized nodewise regression approach to estimate it. We provide performance results in a simulation study and show that MNMs outperform the split-sample based methods Network Comparison Test (NCT) and Fused Graphical Lasso (FGL) in detecting moderation eÔ¨Äects. Finally, we provide a fully reproducible tutorial on how to estimate MNMs with the R-package mgm and discuss possible issues with model misspeciÔ¨Åcation.},

We close this methodological gap by introducing nodewise predictability, which quantifies how well a given node can be predicted by all other nodes it is connected to in the network.

Little research has examined the psychometric properties of the VPT, despite concerns it demonstrates poor test‚Äìretest reliability and internal consistency. These issues can reduce confidence in inferences based on VPT performance. As such, we attempted to identify parameters under which the reliability of the alcohol VPT might be improved by applying recent empirical recommendations for outlier handling, bias calculation, and task design from the anxiety literature. We reanalyzed data from 3 previously published studies in our laboratory and 2 newly collected data sets. We compared tasks which presented images on the left/right of the screen to above/below, whether participants responded to the location or content of the probe, and whether general alcohol-related images or images personalized to the individual were used. In each VPT we also applied a priori outlier removal (2 and 3 standard deviations and median absolute difference) and data-driven outlier removal (winsorizing), in addition to calculating trial-level bias scores. Across all studies and tasks internal consistency and test‚Äìretest reliability of attentional bias measures were inadequate. There was no consistent improvement in internal consistency or test‚Äìretest reliability as a function of outlier removal methods. We were unable to demonstrate adequate reliability of the alcohol VPT, which further supports observations that these tasks may not yield reliable measures. Future research should focus on improving the reliability of these tasks or abandoning them in favor of more reliable alternatives.},

Each protocol was administered to approximately half of 125 samples that comprised 15,305 participants from 36 countries and territories. Using the conventional criterion of statistical significance (p {\textbackslash}textless .05), we found that 15 (54\%) of the replications provided evidence of a statistically significant effect in the same direction as the original finding. With a strict significance criterion (p {\textbackslash}textless .0001), 14 (50\%) of the replications still provided such evidence, a reflection of the extremely highpowered design. Seven (25\%) of the replications yielded effect sizes larger than the original ones, and 21 (75\%) yielded effect sizes smaller than the original ones. The median comparable Cohen‚Äôs ds were 0.60 for the original findings and 0.15 for the replications. The effect sizes were small ({\textbackslash}textless 0.20) in 16 of the replications (57\%), and 9 effects (32\%) were in the direction opposite the direction of the original effect. Across settings, the Q statistic indicated significant heterogeneity in 11 (39\%) of the replication effects, and most of those were among the findings with the largest overall effect sizes; only 1 effect that was near zero in the aggregate showed significant heterogeneity according to this measure. Only 1 effect had a tau value greater than .20, an indication of moderate heterogeneity. Eight others had tau values near or slightly above .10, an indication of slight heterogeneity. Moderation tests indicated that very little heterogeneity was attributable to the order in which the tasks were performed or whether the tasks were administered in lab versus online. Exploratory comparisons revealed little heterogeneity between Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) cultures and less WEIRD cultures (i.e., cultures with relatively high and low WEIRDness scores, respectively). Cumulatively, variability in the observed effect sizes was attributable more to the effect being studied than to the sample or setting in which it was studied.},

	abstract = {Objective: Frequent co-occurrence and bidirectional longitudinal associations have led some researchers to question the boundaries between depression and anxiety. A longitudinal investigation of the interconnected symptom structure of these constructs may help determine the extent to which they are distinct, and whether this changes over development. Therefore, the present study used network analysis to examine these symptom√Äsymptom associations developmentally from early childhood to mid-adolescence. Method: We analyzed data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (N ¬º 1,147). Depression and anxiety symptoms were assessed on 7 occasions between ages 5 and 14 years using maternal reports. Regularized partial correlation networks were constructed at each time point, and diagnostic boundaries were explored using empirical tests of network modularity (ie, clustering of symptom nodes). Nonparametric permutation tests were used to determine whether symptoms became more associated over development, and network centrality was examined to identify developmental changes in the overall importance of speciÔ¨Åc symptoms. Results: Symptoms formed highly interconnected networks, as evidenced by strong associations between depression and anxiety symptoms and a lack of distinct clustering. There was some evidence of an increase in overall connectivity as children aged. Feeling ‚Äúanxious/fearful‚Äù and ‚Äúunhappy/sad‚Äù were consistently the most central symptoms over development. Conclusion: Minimal clustering of nodes indicated no separation of depression and anxiety symptoms from early childhood through mid-adolescence. An increase in connectivity over development suggests that symptoms may reinforce each other, potentially contributing to the high levels of lifetime continuity of these disorders.},

	abstract = {To summarise skewed (asymmetric) distributions, such as reaction times, typically the mean or the median are used as measures of central tendency. Using the mean might seem surprising, given that it provides a poor measure of central tendency for skewed distributions, whereas the median provides a better indication of the location of the bulk of the observations. However, the sample median is biased: with small sample sizes, it tends to overestimate the population median. This is not the case for the mean. Based on this observation, Miller (1988) concluded that ‚Äùsample medians must not be used to compare reaction times across experimental conditions when there are unequal numbers of trials in the conditions.‚Äù Here we replicate and extend Miller (1988), and demonstrate that his conclusion was ill-advised for several reasons. First, the median‚Äôs bias can be corrected using a percentile bootstrap bias correction. Second, a careful examination of the sampling distributions reveals that the sample median is median unbiased, whereas the mean is median biased when dealing with skewed distributions. That is, on average the sample mean estimates the population mean, but typically this is not the case. In addition, simulations of false and true positives in various situations show that no method dominates. Crucially, neither the mean nor the median are sufÔ¨Åcient or even necessary to compare skewed distributions. Different questions require different methods and it would be unwise to use the mean or the median in all situations. Better tools are available to get a deeper understanding of how distributions differ: we illustrate a powerful alternative that relies on quantile estimation. All the code and data to reproduce the Ô¨Ågures and analyses in the article are available online.},

That perspective assumes that psychological variables conform to a common factor model, such that they consist of construct variance plus error. In this paper, we explore what happens when a set of items that are not generated from a common factor construct model are nonetheless modeled as reflecting a common factor. Through a series of hypothetical examples and an empirical re-analysis, we show that (1) common factor models tend to produce extremely biased and highly variable structural parameter estimates when the population model is not a common factor model; (2) model fit is a poor indicator of the degree of bias; and (3) composite models are sometimes more reliable than common factor models under alternative measurement structures, though they also lead to unacceptably bad solutions in some cases.},

	abstract = {An ever-growing number of transdiagnostic processes that maintain psychopathology across disorders have been identified. However, such processes are not consistently associated with psychological distress and symptoms. An understanding of what makes such processes pathological is required. One possibility is that individual differences in rigidity in the implementation of these processes determine the degree of psychopathology. The aim of this article is to examine the relationship between rigidity/flexibility and transdiagnostic maintenance processes. Initial searches were made for research examining relationships between 18 transdiagnostic processes and rigidity/flexibility. Relationships between rumination, perfectionism, impulsivity and compulsivity, and rigidity/flexibility were systemically reviewed; 50 studies met inclusion criteria. The majority of studies indicated that transdiagnostic cognitive and behavioral maintenance processes and rigidity were correlated, co-occurring, or predictive of each other. Findings are consistent with the hypothesis that it is inflexibility in the manner in which processes are employed that makes them pathologically problematic. However, further research is required to test and establish this.},

	abstract = {The words that people use have been found to reflect stable psychological traits, but less is known about the extent to which everyday fluctuations in spoken language reflect transient psychological states. We explored within-person associations between spoken words and selfreported state emotion among 185 participants who wore the Electronically Activated Recorder (EAR; an unobtrusive audio recording device) and completed experience sampling reports of their positive and negative emotions four times per day for seven days (1,579 observations). We examined language using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count program (LIWC; theoretically created dictionaries) and open-vocabulary themes (clusters of data-driven semantically-related words). Although some studies give the impression that LIWC‚Äôs positive and negative emotion dictionaries can be used as indicators of emotion experience, we found that when computed on spoken language, LIWC emotion scores were not significantly associated with self-reports of state emotion experience. Exploration of other categories of language variables suggests a number of hypotheses about substantive everyday correlates of momentary positive and negative emotion that can be tested in future studies. These findings (1) suggest that LIWC positive and negative emotion dictionaries may not capture self-reported subjective emotion experience when applied to everyday speech, (2) emphasize the importance of establishing the validity of language-based measures within one‚Äôs target domain, (3) demonstrate the potential for developing new hypotheses about personality processes from the open-ended words that occur in everyday speech, and (4) extend perspectives on intra-individual variability to the domain of spoken language.},

We propose that principles and techniques from the field of machine learning can help psychology become a more predictive science. We review some of the fundamental concepts and tools of machine learning and point out examples where these concepts have been used to conduct interesting and important psychological research that focuses on predictive research questions.

In this paper, we explore the Ô¨Åeld-wide inability to assess whether inhibition is uniÔ¨Åed or disparate. We do so by showing that ordinary methods of correlating performance including those with latent variable models are doomed to fail because of trial noise (or, as it is sometimes called, measurement error). We then develop hierarchical models that account for variation across trials, variation across individuals, and covariation across individuals and tasks. These hierarchical models also fail to uncover correlations in typical designs for the same reasons. While we can charaterize the degree of trial noise, we cannot recover correlations in typical designs that enroll hundreds of people. We discuss possible improvements to study designs to help uncovering correlations, though we are not sure how feasible they are.},

	abstract = {In modern individual-diÔ¨Äerence studies, researchers often correlate performance on various tasks to uncover common latent processes. Yet, in some sense, the results have been disappointing as correlations among tasks that seemingly have processes in common are often low. A pressing question then is whether these attenuated correlations reÔ¨Çect statistical considerations, such as a lack of individual variability on tasks, or substantive considerations, such as that inhibition in diÔ¨Äerent tasks is not a uniÔ¨Åed concept. One problem in addressing this question is that researchers aggregate performance across trials to tally individual-by-task scores, and the covariation of these scores is subsequently studied much as it would be with classical test theory. It is tempting to think that aggregation here is Ô¨Åne and everything comes out in the wash, but as shown here, it greately attenuates measures of eÔ¨Äect size and correlation. We propose an alternative psychometrics of task performance that is based on accounting for trial-by-trial variability along with the covariation of individuals‚Äô performance across tasks. The implementation is through common hierarchical models, and this treatment rescues classical concepts of eÔ¨Äect size, reliability, and correlation for studying individual diÔ¨Äerences with experimental tasks. Using recent data from Hedge et al. (2018) we show that there is Bayes-factor support for a lack of correlation between the Stroop and Ô¨Çanker task. This support for a lack of correlation indicates a psychologically relevant result‚ÄîStroop and Ô¨Çanker inhibition are seemingly unrelated, contradicting uniÔ¨Åed concepts of inhibition.},

	volume = {1},
	abstract = {The recent field-wide emphasis on power has brought the number of participants used in psychological experiments into focus. Social psychology typically follows a tradition in which many participants perform a small number of trials each; in psychophysics, the tradition is to include only a few participants, who perform many trials each; and the tradition in cognitive psychology falls in between, balancing the number of participants and trials. We ask whether it is better to add trials or to add participants if one wishes to increase power. The answer is straightforward‚Äîgreatest power is achieved by using more people, and the gain from adding people is greater than the gain from adding trials. In light of these results, the design parameters in the social psychology tradition seem ideal. Yet there are conditions in which one may trade people for trials with only a minor decrement in power. Under these conditions, the limiting factor is the trial-to-trial variability rather than the variability across people in the population. These conditions are highly plausible, and we present a theoretical argument as to why. We think that most cognitive effects are characterized by stochastic dominance; that is, everyone‚Äôs true effect is in the same direction. For example, it is plausible that when performing the Stroop task, all people truly identify congruent colors faster than incongruent ones. When dominance holds, small mean effects imply a small degree of variability across the population. It is this degree of homogeneity, the consequence of dominance, that licenses the design parameters of the cognitive psychology and psychophysics traditions.},

We reviewed a representative sample of articles published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology for construct validity evidence. We report that latent variable measurement, in which responses to items are used to represent a construct, is pervasive in social and personality research. However, the field does not appear to be engaged in best practices for ongoing construct validation. We found that validity evidence of existing and author-developed scales was lacking, with coefficient a often being the only psychometric evidence reported. We provide a discussion of why the construct validation framework is important for social and personality researchers and recommendations for improving practice.},

The FP:FN ratio varies greatly across different epidemiologic areas. In genetic epidemiology, it has varied from very high values (possibly even œæ100:1) for associations reported in candidate-gene studies to very low values (1:100 or lower) for associations with genome-wide signiÔ¨Åcance. The substantial reduction over time in the FP:FN ratio in human genome epidemiology has corresponded to the routine adoption of stringent inferential criteria and comprehensive, agnostic reporting of all analyses. Most traditional Ô¨Åelds of epidemiologic research more closely follow the practices of past candidate gene epidemiology, and thus have high FP:FN ratios. Further, FP and FN results do not necessarily entail the same consequences, and their relative importance may vary in different settings. This ultimately has implications for what is the acceptable FP:FN ratio and for how the results of published epidemiologic studies should be presented and interpreted.},

	abstract = {There is increasing concern that most current published research Ô¨Åndings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientiÔ¨Åc Ô¨Åeld. In this framework, a research Ô¨Ånding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a Ô¨Åeld are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater Ô¨Çexibility in designs, deÔ¨Ånitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater Ô¨Ånancial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientiÔ¨Åc Ô¨Åeld in chase of statistical signiÔ¨Åcance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientiÔ¨Åc Ô¨Åelds, claimed research Ô¨Åndings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias.

	title = {Response interference tasks as indirect measures of automatic associations.},
	isbn = {978-1-60623-015-2 (Hardcover)},
	abstract = {A large proportion of research in social psychology uses self-report measures to assess socially relevant constructs, such as attitudes, stereotypes, self-concepts, and self-esteem. Over the past century, self-report measures have provided important insights that built the foundation for many prominent theories in the field. At the same time, there have been persistent concerns that self-report measures are suboptimal research tools for at least two reasons. First, responses on self-report measures are susceptible to self-presentation, which may distort measurement outcomes in socially sensitive domains. Second, there is consensus that many psychological processes operate outside of conscious awareness, which undermines the suitability of self-report measures to assess mental contents that are introspectively inaccessible. To overcome these problems, psychologists have developed various indirect measurement procedures that (1) reduce participants' ability to control their responses, and (2) do not require introspection for the assessment of mental contents. This chapter reviews a particularly influential class of indirect measurement procedures, namely, experimental paradigms based on response interference (RI). For this purpose, we first provide a general context for our review of RI tasks by defining a number of relevant concepts and briefly describing the history of RI tasks in social psychology. After explaining the basic logic of RI, we then review different kinds of measures based on RI, including general information about their procedures, implementation, and scoring. We conclude our chapter with a discussion of general issues regarding the interpretation of RI effects and a pragmatically oriented comparison of the reviewed tasks. The tasks reviewed in this chapter‚Äîincluding the sequential priming tasks reviewed by Spruyt et al.‚Äîare often referred to as implicit measures. A common source of confusion with regard to this label is the meaning of the term implicit, which is further discussed in this chapter. In this chapter, we follow suggestions by De Houwer to use the terms direct and indirect to describe features of measurement procedures, and the terms implicit and explicit to describe features of the psychological attributes assessed by different measurement procedures. In terms of De Houwer's distinction, RI tasks fall under the category of indirect measurement procedures, in that participants are not asked directly to provide a self-assessment of the relevant psychological attribute. Another important issue concerns terminology for the particular constructs assessed by RI tasks. We describe the constructs assessed by RI tasks as automatic associations. Note, however, that the presumed automatic nature of these associations is not guaranteed by the indirect nature of the measurement procedures. Whether the associations assessed by RI tasks are indeed unconscious, efficient, unintentional, and/or uncontrollable is an empirical question that has to be tested by means of carefully designed studies. Thus, our use of the term automatic association simply reflects the general purpose of RI tasks to assess associations that are in fact automatic rather than a methodological necessity that is logically implied by the indirect nature of RI tasks. We return to this issue in the concluding sections of this chapter when we discuss general issues regarding the interpretation of measurement scores.

	abstract = {Two leading theories within the Ô¨Åeld of suicide prevention are the interpersonal psychological theory of suicidal behaviour (IPT) and the integrated motivational-volitional (IMV) model. The IPT posits that suicidal thoughts emerge from high levels of perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness. The IMV model is a multivariate framework that conceptualizes defeat and entrapment as key drivers of suicide ideation. We applied network analysis to cross-sectional data collected as part of the Scottish Wellbeing Study, in which a nationally representative sample of 3508 young adults (18‚Äì34 years) completed a battery of psychological measures. Network analysis can help us to understand how the diÔ¨Äerent theoretical components interact and how they relate to suicide ideation. Within a network that included only the core factors from both models, internal entrapment and perceived burdensomeness were most strongly related to suicide ideation. The core constructs defeat, external entrapment and thwarted belonginess were mainly related to other factors than suicide ideation. Within the network of all available psychological factors, 12 of the 20 factors were uniquely related to suicide ideation, with perceived burdensomeness, internal entrapment, depressive symptoms and history of suicide ideation explaining the most variance. None of the factors was isolated, and we identiÔ¨Åed four larger clusters: mental wellbeing, interpersonal needs, personality, and suicide-related factors. Overall, the results suggest that relationships between suicide ideation and psychological risk factors are complex, with some factors contributing direct risk, and others having indirect impact.},

	abstract = {There is substantial evidence that heightened anxiety vulnerability is characterized by increased selective attention to threatening information. The reliability of this anxiety-linked attentional bias has become the focus of considerable recent interest. We distinguish between the potential inconsistency of anxiety-linked attentional bias and inconsistency potentially reflecting the psychometric properties of the assessment approaches used to measure it. Though groups with heightened anxiety vulnerability often exhibit, on average, elevated attention to threat, the evidence suggests that individuals are unlikely to each display a stable, invariant attentional bias to threat. Moreover, although existing assessment approaches can differentiate between groups, they do not exhibit the internal consistency or test-retest reliability necessary to classify individuals in terms of their characteristic pattern of attentional responding to threat. We discuss the appropriate uses of existing attentional bias assessment tasks and propose strategies for enhancing classification of individuals in terms of their tendency to display an attentional bias to threat.},

Within a network that included only the core factors from both models, internal entrapment and perceived burdensomeness were most strongly related to suicide ideation. The core constructs defeat, external entrapment and thwarted belonginess were mainly related to other factors than suicide ideation. Within the network of all available psychological factors, 12 of the 20 factors were uniquely related to suicide ideation, with perceived burdensomeness, internal entrapment, depressive symptoms and history of suicide ideation explaining the most variance. None of the factors was isolated, and we identiÔ¨Åed four larger clusters: mental wellbeing, interpersonal needs, personality, and suicide-related factors. Overall, the results suggest that relationships between suicide ideation and psychological risk factors are complex, with some factors contributing direct risk, and others having indirect impact.},

Unlike other disciplines, there was no reliable lower bound prevalence estimate of scientific misconduct based on identified cases available for psychology. Thus, we conducted an additional empirical investigation on the basis of retractions in the database PsycINFO. Our analyses showed that 0.82 per 10,000 journal articles in psychology were retracted due to scientific misconduct. Between the late 1990s and 2012, there was a steep increase. Articles retracted due to scientific misconduct were identified in 20 out of 22 PsycINFO subfields.

However, it remains unknown whether this reflects impaired goal identification or impaired goal execution, because, to date, no procedure has been developed to independently assess these two components of anti-saccade cost. The aim of the present study was to develop such an assessment task, which we term the Goal Identification Vs. Execution (GIVE) task. Fifty-one undergraduate students completed a conventional anti-saccade task, and our novel GIVE task. Our findings revealed that individual differences in anti-saccade goal identification costs and goal execution costs were uncorrelated, when assessed using the GIVE task, but both predicted unique variance in the conventional anti-saccade cost measure. These results confirm that the GIVE task is capable of independently assessing variation in the goal identification and goal execution components of the anti-saccade effect. We discuss how this newly introduced assessment procedure now can be employed to illuminate the specific basis of the increased anti-saccade cost that characterises various forms of clinical dysfunction.},

The paradigm requires simultaneous performance of a visuospatial search and a verbal storage task. These tasks are performed in the presence of either neutral or negative emotional distractor images. Experiments 1 and 2 confirmed our prediction that WMC would be reduced in the context of emotional compared with neutral distractors in student and community samples. Experiment 3 extended these findings to a clinical sample. WMC in motor vehicle accident survivors with a history of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was selectively reduced in the presence of trauma-related emotional distraction compared with survivors without a history of PTSD.

The past years have resulted in over 40 scientific publications and numerous conference symposia and workshops. Now is an excellent moment to take stock of the network approach: What are its most fundamental challenges, and what are potential ways forward in addressing them? After a brief conceptual introduction, we first discuss challenges to network theory: (1) What is the validity of the network approach beyond some commonly investigated disorders such as major depression? (2) How do we best define psychopathological networks and their constituent elements? And (3) how can we gain a better understanding of the causal nature and real-life underpinnings of associations among symptoms? Next, after a short technical introduction to network modeling, we discuss challenges to network methodology: (4) heterogeneity of samples studied with network analytic models, and (5) a lurking replicability crisis in this strongly data-driven and exploratory field. Addressing these challenges may propel the network approach from its adolescence into adulthood and promises advances in understanding psychopathology both at the nomothetic and idiographic level.},

	abstract = {Resilience is still often viewed as a unitary personality construct that, as a kind of antinosological entity, protects individuals against stress-related mental problems. However, increasing evidence indicates that maintaining mental health in the face of adversity results from complex and dynamic processes of adaptation to stressors that involve the activation of several separable protective factors. Such resilience factors can reside at biological, psychological, and social levels and may include stable predispositions (such as genotype or personality traits) and malleable properties, skills, capacities, or external circumstances (such as gene-expression patterns, emotion-regulation abilities, appraisal styles, or social support). We abandon the notion of resilience as an entity here. Starting from a conceptualization of psychiatric disorders as dynamic networks of interacting symptoms that may be driven by stressors into stable maladaptive states of disease, we deconstruct the maintenance of mental health during stressor exposure into timevariant dampening influences of resilience factors onto these symptom networks. Resilience factors are separate additional network nodes that weaken symptom‚Äìsymptom interconnections or symptom autoconnections, thereby preventing maladaptive system transitions. We argue that these hybrid symptom-and-resilience-factor networks provide a promising new way of unraveling the complex dynamics of mental health.},

The core constructs defeat, external entrapment and thwarted belonginess were mainly related to other factors than suicide ideation. Within the network of all available psychological factors, 12 of the 20 factors were uniquely related to suicide ideation, with perceived burdensomeness, internal entrapment, depressive symptoms and history of suicide ideation explaining the most variance. None of the factors was isolated, and we identiÔ¨Åed four larger clusters: mental wellbeing, interpersonal needs, personality, and suicide-related factors. Overall, the results suggest that relationships between suicide ideation and psychological risk factors are complex, with some factors contributing direct risk, and others having indirect impact.},

The reliability of this anxiety-linked attentional bias has become the focus of considerable recent interest. We distinguish between the potential inconsistency of anxiety-linked attentional bias and inconsistency potentially reflecting the psychometric properties of the assessment approaches used to measure it. Though groups with heightened anxiety vulnerability often exhibit, on average, elevated attention to threat, the evidence suggests that individuals are unlikely to each display a stable, invariant attentional bias to threat. Moreover, although existing assessment approaches can differentiate between groups, they do not exhibit the internal consistency or test-retest reliability necessary to classify individuals in terms of their characteristic pattern of attentional responding to threat. We discuss the appropriate uses of existing attentional bias assessment tasks and propose strategies for enhancing classification of individuals in terms of their tendency to display an attentional bias to threat.},

	abstract = {Objectives. Depression is characterized by a range of systematic negative biases in thinking and information processing. These biases are believed to play a causal role in the aetiology and maintenance of depression, and it has been proposed that the combined effect of cognitive biases may have greater impact on depression than individual biases alone. Yet little is known about how these biases interact during adolescence when onset is most common. Methods. In this study, adolescents were recruited from the community (n = 212) and from a Child And Adolescent Mental Health Service (n = 84). Participants completed measures of depressive symptoms, interpretation bias, self-evaluation, and recall memory. These included the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire, Ambiguous Scenarios Test for Depression in Adolescents, Self-Description Questionnaire, and an immediate recall task. The clinically referred sample also took part in a formal diagnostic interview. Results. Individual cognitive biases were signiÔ¨Åcantly intercorrelated and associated with depression severity. The combination of cognitive biases was a stronger predictor of depression severity than individual biases alone, predicting 60\% of the variance in depression severity across all participants. There were two signiÔ¨Åcant predictors, interpretation bias and negative self-evaluation; however, almost all of the variance was explained by negative self-evaluation. Conclusions. The Ô¨Åndings support the interrelationship and additive effect of biases in explaining depression and suggest that understanding the way in which cognitive biases interact could be important in advancing methods of identiÔ¨Åcation, early intervention, and treatment.},

	abstract = {Psychological science relies on behavioral measures to assess cognitive processing; however, the field has not yet developed a tradition of routinely examining the reliability of these behavioral measures. Reliable measures are essential to draw robust inferences from statistical analyses, and subpar reliability has severe implications for measures‚Äô validity and interpretation. Without examining and reporting the reliability of measurements used in an analysis, it is nearly impossible to ascertain whether results are robust or have arisen largely from measurement error. In this article, we propose that researchers adopt a standard practice of estimating and reporting the reliability of behavioral assessments of cognitive processing. We illustrate the need for this practice using an example from experimental psychopathology, the dot-probe task, although we argue that reporting reliability is relevant across fields (e.g., social cognition and cognitive psychology). We explore several implications of low measurement reliability and the detrimental impact that failure to assess measurement reliability has on interpretability and comparison of results and therefore research quality. We argue that researchers in the field of cognition need to report measurement reliability as routine practice so that more reliable assessment tools can be developed. To provide some guidance on estimating and reporting reliability, we describe the use of bootstrapped split-half estimation and intraclass correlation coefficients to estimate internal consistency and test-retest reliability, respectively. For future researchers to build upon current results, it is imperative that all researchers provide psychometric information sufficient for estimating the accuracy of inferences and informing further development of cognitive-behavioral assessments.},

Using data from four repeated-measures experiments, we show that effect heterogeneity can be modeled readily, that its discovery presents exciting opportunities for theory and methods, and that allowing for it in study designs is good research practice.

What are the implications of these changes for productivity, creativity, and progress in psychological science? These questions can and should be studied empirically, and I present my predictions here. The productivity of individual researchers is likely to decline, although some changes (e.g., greater collaboration, data sharing) may mitigate this effect. The effects of these changes on creativity are likely to be mixed: Researchers will be less likely to pursue risky questions; more likely to use a broad range of methods, designs, and populations; and less free to define their own best practices and standards of evidence. Finally, the rate of scientific progress‚Äîthe most important shared goal of scientists‚Äîis likely to increase as a result of these changes, although one‚Äôs subjective experience of making progress will likely become rarer.},

	abstract = {Most published meta-analyses address only artifactual variance due to sampling error and ignore the role of other statistical and psychometric artifacts, such as measurement error variance (due to factors including unreliability of measurements, group misclassification, and variable treatment strength) and selection effects (including range restriction or enhancement and collider biases). These artifacts can have severe biasing effects on the results of individual studies and meta-analyses. Failing to account for these artifacts can lead to inaccurate conclusions about the mean effect size and between-studies effect-size heterogeneity, and can influence the results of meta-regression, publication-bias, and sensitivity analyses. In this article, we provide a brief introduction to the biasing effects of measurement error variance and selection effects and their relevance to a variety of research designs. We describe how to estimate the effects of these artifacts in different research designs and correct for their impacts in primary studies and meta-analyses. We consider meta-analyses of correlations, observational group differences, and experimental effects. We provide R code to implement the corrections described.},

	abstract = {The idea that birth-order position has a lasting impact on personality has been discussed for the past 100 years. Recent large-scale studies have indicated that birth-order effects on the Big Five personality traits are negligible. In the current study, we examined a variety of more narrow personality traits in a large representative sample (n = 6,500‚Äì10,500 in between-family analyses; n = 900‚Äì1,200 in within-family analyses). We used specification-curve analysis to assess evidence for birth-order effects across a range of models implementing defensible yet arbitrary analytical decisions (e.g., whether to control for age effects or to exclude participants on the basis of sibling spacing). Although specificationcurve analysis clearly confirmed the previously reported birth-order effect on intellect, we found no meaningful effects on life satisfaction, locus of control, interpersonal trust, reciprocity, risk taking, patience, impulsivity, or political orientation. The lack of meaningful birth-order effects on self-reports of personality was not limited to broad traits but also held for more narrowly defined characteristics.},

These decisions probably introduce bias (towards the narrative put forward by the authors), and certainly involve variability not reflected by standard errors. To address this source of noise and bias, we introduce Specification Curve Analysis, which consists of three steps: (i) identifying the set of theoretically justified, statistically valid, and non-redundant specifications, (ii) displaying the results graphically, allowing readers to identify consequential specifications decisions, and (iii) conducting joint inference across all specifications. We illustrate the usefulness of this technique by applying specification curve to three findings from two different papers, one investigating discrimination based on distinctively black names, and the other investigating the effect of assigning female vs. male names to hurricanes). Specification curve reveals that one finding is robust, one is weak, one is not robust at all.},

However, much of this research is analyzed using ANOVA on aggregated responses because researchers are not confident specifying and interpreting mixed effects models. The tutorial will explain how to simulate data with random effects structure and analyse the data using linear mixed effects regression (with the lme4 R package), with a focus on interpreting the output in light of the simulated parameters. Data simulation can not only enhance understanding of how these models work, but also enables researchers to perform power calculations for complex designs.},

	abstract = {Empirical research inevitably includes constructing a data set by processing raw data into a form ready for statistical analysis. Data processing often involves choices among several reasonable options for excluding, transforming, and coding data. We suggest that instead of performing only one analysis, researchers could perform a multiverse analysis, which involves performing all analyses across the whole set of alternatively processed data sets corresponding to a large set of reasonable scenarios. Using an example focusing on the effect of fertility on religiosity and political attitudes, we show that analyzing a single data set can be misleading and propose a multiverse analysis as an alternative practice. A multiverse analysis offers an idea of how much the conclusions change because of arbitrary choices in data construction and gives pointers as to which choices are most consequential in the fragility of the result.},

	abstract = {Twenty-nine teams involving 61 analysts used the same data set to address the same research question: whether soccer referees are more likely to give red cards to dark-skin-toned players than to light-skin-toned players. Analytic approaches varied widely across the teams, and the estimated effect sizes ranged from 0.89 to 2.93 (Mdn = 1.31) in odds-ratio units. Twenty teams (69\%) found a statistically significant positive effect, and 9 teams (31\%) did not observe a significant relationship. Overall, the 29 different analyses used 21 unique combinations of covariates. Neither analysts‚Äô prior beliefs about the effect of interest nor their level of expertise readily explained the variation in the outcomes of the analyses. Peer ratings of the quality of the analyses also did not account for the variability. These findings suggest that significant variation in the results of analyses of complex data may be difficult to avoid, even by experts with honest intentions. Crowdsourcing data analysis, a strategy in which numerous research teams are recruited to simultaneously investigate the same research question, makes transparent how defensible, yet subjective, analytic choices influence research results.},
